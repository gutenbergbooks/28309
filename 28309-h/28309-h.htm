<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>
<p>It was a hot July day, set in a sky of unruffled blue,
with sharp shadows across road and field, and a wind
that had little coolness in it playing languidly over
the downland. The long white dusty road kept its
undeviating course eastward over hill and dale, through
hamlet and town, till it was swallowed up in the mesh-work
of ways round London, sixty-three miles away
according to the mile-stone by which a certain small
boy clad in workhouse garb was loitering. He had
read the inscription many times and parcelled out the
sixty-three miles into various days&#8217; journeys, but never
succeeded in bringing it within divisionable distance
of the few pennies which found their way into his
pockets. His precocious little head carried within it
too bitter memories of hungry days, and too many
impressions of the shifts and contrivances by which
fortune&#8217;s votaries bamboozle from that fickle Goddess
a meagre living, to adventure on the journey unprepared.
Moreover, Mr. and Mrs. Moss of the Whitmansworth
Union were not unkind, and meals were
regular, so he did not run away from the house that
had opened its doors to him and an exhausted mother
six months ago. But he still dreamt of London as
the desideratum of his fondest hopes, and that, in
spite of a black terror crouching there and carefully
nurtured by the poor mother in the days of their wanderings.
He saw it all through a haze of people and
experiences, of friends and foes, and it was the Place
of Liberty.</p>
<p>Therefore, when escape was possible from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
somewhat easy rule of the Union, he hurried away to
the mile-stone on the &#8220;Great Road,&#8221; as it was called
about here. The stone with its clear distinct black
lettering, seemed to bring him nearer London, and he
would spend his time contentedly flinging pebbles
into the river of dust at his feet, or planning out in
his active little mind what he would do when old
Granny Jane&#8217;s prophecy came true.</p>
<p>There was a wide strip of turf on each side of the
road bejewelled with poppies and daisies, matted with
yellow and white bedstraws, carpeted with clovers,
and over all lay a coating of fine chalky dust, legacy
of passing cart and carriage.</p>
<p>The boy was very hot and very dusty, and a little
sleepy. He lay on his back drumming his heels on
the turf and watching an exuberant lark tower up
into the sky above him. He was not unmindful of the
lark&#8217;s song, but he vaguely wondered if a well-thrown
stone could travel as far as the dark mounting speck.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a year ago I am sure since that old woman
told me my fortune,&#8221; he said, suddenly sitting up. &#8220;I
wonder if it will come true. Mother said it was nonsense.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a lonely stretch of road. The mile-stone
was on the summit of a rise and the ground sloped
away on his right to a reach of green water-meadow
through which a chalky trout-stream wandered, and
the red roof of an old mill showed through a group
of silvery poplars and willows. On the other side of
the road were undulating fields that dwindled from
sparse cultivation to bare down-land. There was no
sign of any house except the distant mill, but directly
over the summit of the hill, happily hidden, an ugly
little red-brick mushroom of a town asserted itself,
overgrowing in its unbeautiful growth the older picturesque
village of Whitmansworth.</p>
<p>The faint sharp click of horses&#8217; hoofs stepping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
swiftly and regularly swept up the road towards the
boy. He stood up the better to see the approaching
vehicle which was coming from out of the east towards
him. Two horses, he judged, listening intently.
Presently a distant dark spot on the road evolved itself
into a carriage&mdash;a phaeton and a pair of iron grey
horses. It was long before the days of motors, when
fine horses and good drivers were common enough in
England, but even the small boy recognised that these
animals were exceptional and were stepping out at a
pace that spoke of good blood, good training and good
hands on the reins.</p>
<p>He watched them trot full pace down the opposite
hill and breast the steep rise after without a break in
the easy rhythm of their movements. It was a matter
of their driver&#8217;s will rather than their pleasure that
made them slacken pace as they neared the mile-stone.</p>
<p>The lonely little figure standing there was clearly
visible to the travellers in the phaeton. The man who
was driving looked at him casually, looked again with
sudden sharp scrutiny, and abruptly pulled up his
horses. He thrust the reins into his companion&#8217;s
hands, and was off the box before the groom from
behind could reach the horses&#8217; heads.</p>
<p>The owner of the phaeton came straight towards
the small boy who was watching the horses with interest,
pleased at the halt and oblivious of his own
connection with it. The traveller was a man who
looked forty-eight despite his frosted hair, and was in
reality ten years older. He was tall, well beyond average
height, thin, well-fashioned, with a keen kindly
face, clean shaven. His mouth was humorous, and
there was a certain serenity of expression and bearing
that invited confidence. The boy, casting a hasty
glance at him as he approached, thought him a very
fine gentleman indeed: as in fact he was, in every possible
meaning of the word.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is this Whitmansworth?&#8221; demanded the owner
of the phaeton. His tone was not aggressive. The
boy gave him as straight a look of judgment as he
himself received.</p>
<p>&#8220;Down there it is,&#8221; with a nod of his head in the
direction of the distant townlet.</p>
<p>&#8220;And not up here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno, they calls it the Great Road.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stranger still stood looking down at him
fixedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your name James Christopher Hibbault?&#8221;</p>
<p>Without warning, without time for the canny little
morsel of humanity to weigh the wisdom of an answer,
the question was shot at him and he was left gasping
and speechless after an incriminating &#8220;Yes,&#8221; forced
from him by the suddenness of the onslaught, and the
truth-compelling power of those keen eyes. &#8220;Least
it&#8217;s Hibbault,&#8221; he added unwillingly. &#8220;Jim, they calls
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is Christopher as well, and I prefer
Christopher. And what are you doing on the Great
Road at this hour in the afternoon, Christopher?&#8221;</p>
<p>And Jim&mdash;or Christopher,&mdash;trained and renowned
for a useful evasiveness of retort in those far-off London
days, answered mechanically: &#8220;Waiting for the
fortune to come true.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the hot blood rushed to his face from sheer
shame at his own betrayal of the darling secret of his
small existence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your fortune?&#8221; echoed the other slowly. &#8220;Fortunes
do not come for waiting. What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the old woman said so&mdash;mother didn&#8217;t
believe it. She said as how my fortune would come
to me on the Great Road. There wer&#8217;n&#8217;t no Great
Road there, so when I heard as how they called this
the Great Road, I just stuck to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a long speech. The boy had none of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
half-stupid stolidity of the country-bred, and yet lacked
something of the garrulity of the cute street lad.
His voice too was a surprise. The broad vowels
seemed acquired and uncertain and jarred on the
hearer with a sense of misfit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you live at Whitmansworth Union?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a faint tinge of resentment in the short
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>How did the gentleman know it, and, anyhow, why
should he tell him? Jim felt irritated.</p>
<p>The owner of the phaeton stood still a moment
with one hand on the dusty little shoulder, and then
looked round at the water-meadows, the distant copses,
the more distant shimmering downs. Then he laughed,
saying something the boy did not understand, and
looked down at the sharp inquiring little face again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which means, Christopher, hide-and-seek is an
easy game when it&#8217;s over,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Come
and show me where you live.&#8221;</p>
<p>They walked back towards the carriage together.
The elderly gentleman holding the reins was looking
back at them; so was the groom. The elderly
gentleman cast a puzzled, inquiring glance from the
boy to his companion as they came near.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fortune meets us on the road-side, Stapleton,&#8221;
said the owner of the phaeton. &#8220;Let me introduce
you to Christopher Hibbault. Get up, child.&#8221;</p>
<p>Get up? Mount that quietly magnificent carriage,
ride behind those beautiful animals with their pawing
feet and arched necks? The small boy stood still a
moment to appreciate the greatness of the event.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you afraid, Christopher?&#8221;</p>
<p>Resentment sprang to life. Yet it was almost well
so transcendent a moment should have its pin prick
of annoyance. With a &#8220;No&#8221; of ineffable scorn, Jim&mdash;or
Christopher&mdash;the name was immaterial to him&mdash;clambered
up into the high carriage and wedged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
himself between the elderly gentleman and the inquisitive
driver, who had regained his seat and the
reins.</p>
<p>Christopher&#8217;s experiences of driving were of a very
limited nature, and certainly they did not embrace
anything like this. He had no recollection of ever
having travelled by train, and it was the question of
pace that fascinated him, the rapid, easy swinging
movement through the air, the fresh breeze rushing
by, the distancing of humbler wayfarers, all gave him
a strange sense of exhilaration. Years afterward,
when flesh and blood were all too slow for him and he
was one of the best motorists in England, if not in
Europe, he used to recall the rapturous pleasure of
that first drive of his, that first introduction to the
mad, tense joy of speed that ever after held him in
thrall.</p>
<p>The owner of the phaeton and the elderly gentleman
whom he had called Stapleton exchanged no remarks,
but they both cast curious, thoughtful glances
at their small companion from time to time. They
had to rouse him from his rhapsody to ask the way at
last. He answered concisely and shortly with no
touch of the local burr.</p>
<p>&#8220;How came you to be so far away?&#8221; demanded
Jim&#8217;s fine gentleman as they were passing through the
market-place.</p>
<p>Jim was engaged in superciliously ignoring the
amazed stares of the town boys who were apt to look
down on the &#8220;workhouse kid,&#8221; though he attended
the Whitmansworth school. Once past them he answered
the question vaguely.</p>
<p>&#8220;The master was out: I hadn&#8217;t to do anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you had permission to wander where you
liked?&#8221;</p>
<p>To this Jim did not reply. He had <i>not</i> permission,
but he counted on the good nature of Mrs. Moss, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
whom he was a favourite, to plead his cause with her
husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;Had you permission?&#8221; demanded his questioner
again, bending down suddenly to look in the boy&#8217;s
face with his disconcerting eyes.</p>
<p>It would have seemed to Jim on reflection a great
deal more prudent and quite as easy to have said
&#8220;yes&#8221; as &#8220;no,&#8221; but the &#8220;no&#8221; slipped out, and the
questioner smiled, not ill-pleased.</p>
<p>At last they came to a standstill before the door of
the Whitmansworth Union. Jim, with a prodigious
sigh, prepared to descend. The glorious adventure
was over. Also he prepared to slip away to a more
lowly entrance, but was stopped by a retaining hand.</p>
<p>The porter, no friend of Jim&#8217;s, stared with dull
amazement at the apparition of the fine turn-out, and
the still finer gentleman waiting on the doorstep with
that little &#8220;varmint&#8221; of a Hibbault. He signed to
the boy angrily to begone, as he ushered the visitor in.</p>
<p>&#8220;The boy will stay with me,&#8221; said the owner of the
phaeton quietly, and they were accordingly shown into
that solemn sanctum, the Board Room. It was a
cheerful room with flowers in the window and a long
green-covered table with comfortable chairs on each
side, but it struck a cold note of discomfort in Jim&#8217;s
heart. The first time he had entered it, about six
months ago, the chairs had been occupied by ten more
or less portly gentlemen who informed him that his
mother, now being dead (she had died two days previously),
they had decided to give him a home
for the present, and would educate him and teach him
a trade, and that he should be very grateful and must
be a good boy.</p>
<p>Jim had said tearfully he would rather go back to
London and Mrs. Sartin, which appeared to surprise
them very much, and they were at some pains to point
out the advantages of a country life, which did not appeal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
to him at all. Then one of them, who had not
spoken before, said abruptly, &#8220;his mother had wished
him to stay there, and there was an end of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was six months ago. Jim remembered it all
very distinctly as he waited with his companion in
the Board Room.</p>
<p>Mr. Moss bustled in: he was a stout, cheerful man
of hasty temper, but withal a man one could deal with&mdash;through
his wife&mdash;in Jim&#8217;s estimation.</p>
<p>He held the card the visitor had sent in between
his fingers and looked flurried and surprised. Jim
noticed he bowed to the stranger, but did not offer to
shake hands as he did with the doctor and parson and
the few rare visitors the boy had observed. So Jim
concluded <i>his</i> gentleman was a very great gentleman
indeed, as he had all along suspected.</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Aston&mdash;Charles Aston&#8221;&mdash;said the
owner of the phaeton in his pleasant voice. &#8220;I have
driven down from London to make inquiries about a
small boy I have reason to believe came under your
care about seven months ago: Hibbault by name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&mdash;Mr. Aston,&#8221; said Mr. Moss, assuming
an air of importance, &#8220;and that is the boy himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A good boy, I hope?&#8221; He bestowed on him one
of those keen, sharp glances Jim was beginning not to
resent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not bad as boys go,&#8221; Mr. Moss answered dubiously,
scratching his chin, &#8220;but his bringing up has
been against him. London, sir,&mdash;and then tramping
about the country for a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim regarded Mr. Aston anxiously to see how this
somewhat negative character struck him, but he was
still looking at Jim and seemed to pay small heed to
Mr. Moss&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>&#8220;We passed him on the road,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I was
struck by the likeness to someone I knew, and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
thought there could not be two boys so like in Whitmansworth.
You were master here when he was admitted?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, Mr. Aston. It was in November last, on
a Thursday night, I remember, because service was
on. The mother was clean exhausted, and was taken
to the infirmary at once and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Aston interposed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christopher, go out and stay by the carriage till
I call you, and ask the gentleman&mdash;Mr. Stapleton&mdash;to
come in here.&#8221;</p>
<p>And James Christopher Hibbault obeyed without
so much as a glance for permission at Mr. Moss.</p>
<p>He delivered his message and then interviewed the
groom, who seemed used to waiting. The tea bell
rang, but Jim, though hungry, never thought of disobeying
his orders. The hall porter came out and
went off on his bicycle and presently returned with
Mr. Page, one of the Board gentlemen.</p>
<p>The groom eventually grew communicative and
told Jim the horses&#8217; names were Castor and Pollux,
and there wasn&#8217;t their match in the country, no more
in all London, though to be sure Mr. Aston had some
fine horses at Marden Court.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that where he lives?&#8221; inquired Jim.</p>
<p>It appeared he lived there sometimes, but Mr. Nevil,&mdash;Jim
did not know who that was&mdash;lived there mostly.
Mr. Aston spent most of his time in London with Mr.
Aymer. They had left London the previous day, Jim
learnt, and had been driving to queer out-of-the-way
places, always stopping at Unions.</p>
<p>At which point the door opened and Mr. Aston
came out, and with him Mr. Page and Mr. and Mrs.
Moss and Mr. Stapleton with a bundle of papers in
his hand, and all these people looked at Jim in a perplexed
way, except Mr. Aston, who appeared quite
happy and unconcerned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Say good-bye to Mrs. Moss, Christopher,&#8221; he said
authoritatively. &#8220;You are coming with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221; demanded the boy with a sudden
access of caution.</p>
<p>&#8220;To London.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher began to scramble up into the carriage
and was unceremoniously hauled down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Manners, Christopher. Mrs. Moss is waiting to
say good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, Mrs. Moss had been very kind to the little
waif and taken him to her motherly childless heart,
and in spite of her excitement over this wonderful
event, or because of it, she could not refrain from a
few tears. Jim was not indifferent to the fact&mdash;any
more than he had been to the lark&#8217;s song, but he
secretly thought it very inconsiderate of her to cloud
this extraordinary adventure with anything so depressing
as tears. He was the more aggrieved as
against his will, against all reason and all tradition
of manliness, he found objectionable salt drops brimming
up in his own eyes. A culminating point was
reached, however, when Mrs. Moss fairly embraced
him. It should be stated that on occasions and in private
Jim had no sort of objection to being cuddled
by Mrs. Moss, who was a comfortable, pillowy sort
of person.</p>
<p>The ordeal was over at last and he was clambering
up into the carriage when Mrs. Moss bethought her
he had had no tea.</p>
<p>Mr. Aston protested they were going to stop at
Basingstoke, but the good woman insisted on provisioning
the boy with a wedge of cake and tucking
a clean handkerchief of her own into his pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall sleep at Basingstoke, and I&#8217;ll send back
his clothes by post,&#8221; said Mr. Aston. &#8220;No doubt we
can get him some sort of temporary outfit there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim, who had been secretly afraid he would be relegated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
to the back seat with the groom, breathed a
sigh of relief as Mr. Aston mounted to his place.
That gentleman apparently understood the innermost
soul of the boy, for he gravely asked Mr. Stapleton
to find room for a companion, and then with a toss
of their proud heads Castor and Pollux moved off.
Mr. Aston raised his hat courteously to Mrs. Moss,
and Jim, observing, made an attempt to remove his
own dingy little cap, a performance everyone took as
a matter of course untill he had gone, when Mrs. Moss
remembered it and exclaimed to her husband: &#8220;Didn&#8217;t
I always say, Joseph, he wasn&#8217;t like the rest of
them?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Joseph only said &#8220;Umph,&#8221; and went in doors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will telegraph to Aymer from Basingstoke,&#8221;
said Mr. Aston as they started, and after that there
was silence.</p>
<p>The monotonous click-clack of the horses&#8217; feet
lulled the tired child into blissful drowsiness. He
had had too many ups and downs in his eleven years
of life to be alarmed at this unexpected turn of fortune,
and he was still too young to grasp how great a
change had been wrought in that life since the hot
hour he had spent lying by the mile-stone on the
Great Road.</p>
<p>As they clattered through the narrow streets of the
country town in the light of the long July evening
Christopher sat up and rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been here before,&#8221; he volunteered.</p>
<p>Mr. Aston effected a skilful pass between a donkey
cart and two perambulators.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, quite right, you have. What do you remember
about it, Christopher?&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy looked dubious and a little distressed, but
just then they passed a chemist&#8217;s shop.</p>
<p>&#8220;We went there,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Mother got something
for her cough, so she couldn&#8217;t have any supper.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
We stayed at a horrid old woman&#8217;s, a nasty, cross
thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did not go to the Union, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we had some money, a whole shilling and
some pennies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Aston said something under his breath and
Mr. Stapleton murmured &#8220;tut-tut-tut.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how we first missed the trail, Stapleton,&#8221;
he said, and then as they walked up a steep hill he
spoke to the boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christopher, I want you to tell me anything you
remember about your mother and the old days if you
wish it, but you must not talk about that to Aymer.
It would make him unhappy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is Aymer?&#8221; asked Christopher, not unreasonably.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aymer is my son, my eldest son. You are going
to live with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he a boy like me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he is quite big, grown up, but he can&#8217;t get
about as you can, he is&mdash;a cripple.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said the words with a sort of forced jerk and
half under his breath, but Christopher heard them and
shivered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you live there, too?&#8221; he asked, pressing a little
nearer the man who was no longer a stranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Live where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With the&mdash;your son.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I live there too. My boy couldn&#8217;t get on
without me&mdash;and here&#8217;s the White Elephant, which
means supper and bed for a tired young man. Jump
down, Christopher.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>
<p>The spirit of waning July hung heavily over London.
In mean streets and alleys it was inexpressibly
dreary: the fagged inhabitants lacked even energy to
quarrel.</p>
<p>But on the high ground westward of the Park,
where big houses demand elbow-room and breathing
space and even occasionally exclusive gardens, a little
breeze sprang up at sundown and lingered on till dusk.</p>
<p>In this region lies one of the most beautiful houses
in London, the country seat of some fine gentleman
in Queen Anne&#8217;s day. It hid its beauties, however,
from the public gaze, lying modestly back in a garden
whose size had no claim to modesty at all. All one
could see from the road, through the iron gates, was
a glimpse of a wide portico, and a long row of windows.
It stood high and in its ample garden the
breeze ran riot, shaking the scent from orange and
myrtle trees, from jasmine and roses, and wafting it
in at the wide open windows of a room which, projecting
from the house, seemed to take command of
the garden.</p>
<p>It was a large room and the windows went from
ceiling to floor. It was also a very beautiful room.
In the gathering dusk the restful harmonies of its colours
melted into soft, hazy blue, making it appear
vaster than it really was. Also, it was unencumbered
by much furniture and what there was so essentially
fitted its place that it was <ins class="trnote" title="Transcriber&amp;#8217;s Note: added a period after unobtrusive">unobtrusive.</ins> Three big
canvases occupied the walls, indiscernible in the dim
light, but masterpieces of world fame, heirlooms
known all over Europe. There was a curious dearth
of small objects and unessentials, nothing in all the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
great space that could fatigue the eye or perplex the
brain of the occupant.</p>
<p>The owner of the room was lying on a big sofa
near one of the open windows. Within reach was a
low bookcase, a table with an electric reading lamp,
and a little row of electric bells, some scattered papers
and an open telegram.</p>
<p>The man on the sofa lay quite still looking into the
garden as it sunk from sight under the slowly falling
veil of purple night.</p>
<p>He was evidently a tall man, with the head and
shoulders of an athlete, and a face of such precise and
unusual beauty that one&#8217;s instinct called out, &#8220;Here,
then, God has planned a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer Aston, indeed, was not unlike his father,
but far more regular in feature, more carefully hewn,
and the serenity of the older face was lacking. Here
was the face of a fighter, alive with the strong passions
held in by a stronger will. There was almost
riotous vitality expressed in his colouring, coppery-coloured
hair and dark brows, eyes of surprising blueness
and a tanned skin, for he spent hours lying in
the sun, hatless and unshaded, with the avowed intention
of &#8220;browning&#8221;; and he &#8220;browned&#8221; well except
for a queer white triangled scar almost in the
centre of his forehead, an ugly mark that showed up
with fresh distinctness when any emotion brought the
quick blood to his face. There was indeed nothing in
his appearance to suggest a cripple or an invalid.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Aymer Aston, aged thirty-five, the
best polo-player, the best fencer, the best athlete of his
day at College, possessing more than his share of the
vigour of youth and glory of life, had, for over ten
years, never moved without help from the sofa on
which he lay, and the strange scar and a certain weakness
in the left hand and arm were the only visible
signs of the catastrophe that had broken his life.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>A thin, angular man entered, and crossed the room
with an apologetic cough.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that you, Vespasian?&#8221; demanded his master
without moving. &#8220;Have they come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, but there is a message from the House. I
believe Mr. Aston is wanted particularly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a nuisance. Why can&#8217;t they let him alone?
He might as well be in office.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man, without asking permission, rearranged
his master&#8217;s cushions with a practised hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;The young gentleman had better have some supper
upstairs, sir, as it&#8217;s so late,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
see to it myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Send him in to me directly they come, Vespasian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>He withdrew as quietly as he had entered and Aymer
continued to look out at the dark, and think over
the change he, of his own will, was about to make in
his monotonous existence. He was so lost in thought
he did not hear the door open again or realise the
&#8220;change&#8221; was actually an accomplished fact till a
half-frightened gasp of &#8220;Oh!&#8221; caught his ear. He
turned as well as he could, unaided.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that you, Christopher?&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice was so singularly like Mr. Aston&#8217;s that
Christopher felt reassured. The dim vastness of the
room had frightened him, also he had thought it
empty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come over here to me,&#8221; said Aymer, holding out
his hand, &#8220;I can&#8217;t come to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher nervously advanced. The brightness
of the corridor outside left his eyes confused in this
dim light. Aymer suddenly remembered this and
turned on a switch. The vague shadowy space was
flooded with soft radiance. It was like magic to the
small boy.</p>
<p>He was first aware of a gorgeous glint of colouring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
in a rug flung across the sofa, and then of a man
lying on a pile of dull-tinted pillows, a man with red
hair and blue eyes, watching him eagerly.</p>
<p>Children as a rule are not susceptible to physical
beauty, turning with undeviating instinct to the inner
soul of things, with a fine disregard for externals, but
Christopher, in this, was rather abnormal. He was
very actively alive to outward form.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Aston had told him Aymer was a cripple
Christopher had been consumed with unspeakable
dread. His idea of a cripple was derived from a distorted,
evil-faced old man who had lived in the same
house that had once sheltered his mother and him.
The mere thought of it made him sick with horror.
And when the tall gentleman in black, who had met
them in the entrance hall and escorted him here, had
opened the door and put him inside, he had much ado
not to rush out again. He conquered his fear with
unrecognised heroism, and this was his reward.</p>
<p>He stood staring, with all his worshipful admiration
writ large on his little tired white face. Aymer
Aston saw it and laughed. He was quite aware of his
own good looks and perfectly unaffected thereby,
though he took some pains to preserve them. But his
vanity had centred itself on one thing in his earlier
life, and that, his great strength, and it died when that
was no more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little Christopher,&#8221; he said, &#8220;come and sit down
by me: you must be tired to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you Mr. Aymer?&#8221; demanded Christopher,
still staring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, only you mustn&#8217;t call me that, I think. I
wonder what you will call me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher offered no solution to the problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like to live here with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked round. A dim sense of alarm crept
back. The room looked so empty and unreal, so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
&#8220;alone.&#8221; Without knowing why, Christopher, who
had never had a real home to pine for, felt miserably
homesick.</p>
<p>Aymer watched him closely and did not press the
question. Instead, he asked him in a matter-of-fact
way to shut the window for him.</p>
<p>The boy did so without blundering. The window-fastening
was new to him, and Aymer noticed he
looked at it curiously and shut it twice to see how it
went. Then he sat down again and continued to gaze
at Aymer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot, I was to tell you something,&#8221; he said
suddenly, his face wrinkling with distress. &#8220;The
other one&mdash;the gentleman who brought me&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher nodded. &#8220;I oughtn&#8217;t to have forgotten.
He said he had to go to the House, but he&#8217;d be
back quite soon, he hoped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s had no dinner, I suppose,&#8221; grumbled Aymer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we had dinner at&mdash;I forget the name of the
place&mdash;and tea. And yesterday we had dinner too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was wise,&#8221; said Aymer gravely. &#8220;Where&#8217;s
Mr. Stapleton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He went home by train this morning. I sat in his
place all the time, not at the back.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused thoughtfully. An idea that had been
dimly forming in his brain, took alarming shape. A
small companion at the Union had lately been sent
out as a page to a kindly family. Christopher wondered
if that was the meaning of all these strange adventures
for him. At the same time he was conscious
of so vast a sense of disappointment that he was compelled
to put his Fate to the test at once. He jerked
out the inquiry with breathless abruptness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I going to be your page?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Page?&#8221; Aymer Aston echoed the words with
consternation; then held out his hand to the child.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t my father tell you?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>A kind of nervous exasperation seized on Christopher.
He was tired, overwrought, puzzled and baffled.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one tells me anything,&#8221; he said petulantly,
blinking hard to keep back the tears; &#8220;they just took
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to be a page boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; It was emphatic to the point of rudeness.</p>
<p>Aymer put his arm round him and drew him near,
laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not going to be a page,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you
are going to be&#8221;&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;&#8220;to be my own boy&mdash;just
as if you were my son. I&#8217;ve adopted you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher&#8217;s dark eyes were fixed on the blue ones
and then he saw the scar for the first time. It interested
him so much he hardly heard Aymer&#8217;s slow answer
when it came.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a great deal of time on my hands, and I
should have liked a son of my own. As I can&#8217;t have
that I&#8217;ve adopted you. Don&#8217;t you think you can
like me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher looked round the room and back at the
sofa. The voice was kind and the arm that was round
him gripped him firmly; also, Mr. Aston had said he
lived here too. That was reassuring. He was not
quite certain how he felt towards this strangely fascinating
man, but he was quite sure of his sentiments
towards Mr. Aston.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Aston lives here, doesn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; do you like him best?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like him very much,&#8221; said Christopher truthfully,
and added considerately, &#8220;You see, I&#8217;ve known
him longer, haven&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must like me too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher was too young to read the passionate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
hunger in the voice and the look. It was gone in a
moment.</p>
<p>Aymer released him, laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there anyone else?&#8221; asked the boy, looking
vaguely round.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone else living here? Only the servants.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean that.&#8221; A puzzled look came into his
face. &#8220;I mean&mdash;there was Mrs. Moss and Grannie
Jane, and Mrs. Sartin and Jessy and mother.&#8221; Then
he recollected Mr. Aston&#8217;s prohibition and got red and
embarrassed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;a woman,&#8221; said Aymer in a strangely
quiet voice.</p>
<p>Christopher noticed the scar again, clear and distinct.
Aymer took out a cigarette and lit it carefully.
Christopher watched dumbly. He wanted to cry: for
no reason that he could discover. Presently Aymer
turned to him as he sat on a low chair by the side of
the wide sofa and put his arm round him again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, little Christopher,&#8221; he said rather huskily,
perhaps because he was smoking, &#8220;but I&#8217;m afraid
I can&#8217;t give you that, old chap. We only&mdash;remember
them here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tired child yielded to the slight pressure of the
arm&mdash;his head dropped against his new friend&mdash;the
room was very quiet&mdash;only Mr. Aymer must have
been mistaken. It seemed to Christopher a thin black-clad
woman was in the room&mdash;somewhere&mdash;she was
looking at Aymer and would not see him at first&mdash;then
she turned her head&mdash;he called &#8220;Mother,&#8221; and
opened his eyes to find Mr. Aymer bending over him.</p>
<p>When Mr. Aston had returned and found Aymer
smoking composedly with one arm round the sleeping
boy, he had pointed out with great care the enormity
of a small child being out of bed at eleven o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p>Aymer put down his cigarette and looked at his
charge.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Vespasian did come for him,&#8221; he confessed; &#8220;I
thought it a pity to wake him till you came. It&#8217;s just
as I feared,&#8221; he added with assumed pathos, &#8220;you
have had first innings and I shall have to take a second
place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only just that he got used to me: I hardly
talked to him at all,&#8221; pleaded Mr. Aston humbly, and
Aymer laughed. Whereupon Christopher woke up,
rubbing his eyes, and smiled sleepily at Mr. Aston.</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave him the message, not just at once, but
almost.&#8221;</p>
<p>His first friend sat down and drew him to his knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what do you think of my big boy?&#8221; asked
Mr. Aston. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been scolding him for not sending
you to bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher looked from one to the other with solemn
eyes, blinking in the light.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scolding him? Isn&#8217;t he too big to be scolded?&#8221;</p>
<p>The men laughed and involuntarily glanced at each
other in a curiously conscious manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;He does not think anyone too big to scold,&#8221; sighed
Aymer resignedly. &#8220;Father, about the name: I&#8217;d
rather tell him to-night.&#8221; His voice was a little hurried.
Mr. Aston glanced at him questioningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you like, Aymer&mdash;if he&#8217;s not too sleepy to
listen. Are you, Christopher?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not tired,&#8221; answered Christopher, valiantly
blinking sleep out of his eyes.</p>
<p>It was Aymer who spoke, slowly and directly. Mr.
Aston kept his eyes on the boy and tried not to see his
son.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your real name, Christopher, do you
know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;James Christopher Hibbault, but they calls me
Jim, except him.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his sleepiness and agitation the boy had dropped
back into country dialect. Aymer winced.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That is the only name you know? Well, Christopher,
it&#8217;s a good name, but all the same I want you
to forget it at present. I want you to call yourself
always, Christopher Aston. Do you think you can remember?&#8221;</p>
<p>The newly-named one stood silent, puzzling out
something in his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will it make me not belong to mother?&#8221; he said
at last.</p>
<p>There was a faint movement on the sofa. It was
Mr. Aston who answered, putting his hand gently
on the boy&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, little Christopher, nothing will make you
cease to belong to her; we do not wish that. But it
will be more easy for you to have our name. We
want Christopher Aston to have a better time than
poor little Jim Hibbault. Only, Christopher, remember
Aston is my name, and I am only lending it to
you, and you must take very great care of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it his name too?&#8221; The child edged a little
nearer his friend, and looked at Aymer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s Aymer&#8217;s name too. And, Christopher, if
we were both to give you everything we possess we
could not give you anything we value more than the
name we lend you, so you must be very good to it.
Now, Aymer, I insist on your ringing for Vespasian:
the child should have been in bed hours ago. I must
really buy you a book of nursery rules.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vespasian was apparently of the same mind as Mr.
Aston. Disapproval was plainly expressed on his usually
impassive face when he entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that Vespasian?&#8221; demanded Christopher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and you will have to do just what he tells
you, Christopher, just as I have to,&#8221; said Aymer severely.</p>
<p>Christopher regarded him doubtfully: he was not
quite sure if he were serious or not. He did not look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
as if people would tell him to do things, yet the grave
man in black did not smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a funny name,&#8221; he said at last, not meaning
to be rude.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vespasian was a great general,&#8221; remarked Aymer,
and then added hastily, seeing the boy&#8217;s bewilderment
increased, &#8220;Not this one, the General&#8217;s dead,
but this is a good second.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aymer, you are incorrigible,&#8221; expostulated Mr.
Aston. &#8220;Good-night, little Christopher.&#8221;</p>
<p>He kissed him and Christopher&#8217;s eyes grew large
with wonder. He did not know men did kiss little
boys, and he ventured slyly to rub his cheek against
the black sleeve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, Christopher.&#8221; Aymer held out his
hand, and then suddenly, half shyly, and half ashamed,
kissed him also, and Vespasian bore him off to bed.</p>
<p>The two men sat silently smoking, avoiding for the
moment the subject nearest their hearts, Aymer, because
he was fighting hard to get some mastering
emotion under control, and he loathed showing his
feelings even to his father; Mr. Aston, because he was
aware of this and wanted Aymer to have time.</p>
<p>All that day he had been secretly dreading to-night,
shrinking like a coward from a situation which must
arouse in his son memories better forgotten. He was
not a man given to shirking unpleasing experiences to
save his own heart a pang, but he was a veritable child
in the way that he studied to preserve his eldest son
from the like.</p>
<p>It was Aymer who first spoke in his usual matter-of-fact
tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Had you any difficulties?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None whatever,&#8221; answered his father, crossing
his legs and preparing to be communicative. &#8220;Stapleton
had been all over the ground before and knew
every point. We went first to Surbiton Workhouse,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
since she told Felton she stayed there. They found
the entry for us. Then we went on to Hartley, which is
quite a small village and off the main road. We stayed
the night there, and went to the cottage where Felton
had seen her. It was quite true, all he said. The old
woman remembered distinctly a tramp-looking man
stopping and calling to her over the gate. They sat
in the garden and talked together for some time.
She and the boy had been there a month, but they went
the day after Felton&#8217;s visit&mdash;seemed frightened, the old
lady said. Apparently they meant to go to Southampton,
for she had asked the way there. Basingstoke
must have been the next stop, but we did not know
where until the boy told us. They were in funds, so
did not go to the House. We got to Whitmansworth
the next afternoon. Then a strange thing happened,
one of those chance coincidences that put to rout all
our schemes. There is a hill going into Whitmansworth
with a milestone on the top. I drove slowly, as
I wanted to see if it really were the place, and by the
stone was a small boy. The likeness was so absurd
that it might have been ...&#8221; he stopped abruptly
and examined his cigar, &#8220;had I not been seeking
him I should have seen it. I found out his name,
and that I was right, and took him up and drove to
the Union. They raised no objections&mdash;it was only
a matter of form. The master and his wife seem
to be good people, and to have been kind to the
boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>He came to a pause again. Aymer still waited. Mr.
Aston walked to the window and looked out at the
night, and then went on without turning:</p>
<p>&#8220;She had never left the slightest clue or given any
hint whatever as to her identity. She was going to
Southampton, she said. But she was dying of exhaustion
then. They could do nothing for her. She asked
them to keep the boy. The Mosses took a fancy to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
him, and it was managed. She would not say where
she came from.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer lay very still, his face set and immovable.</p>
<p>&#8220;The strength of her purpose: think of it, in a
woman!&#8221; said Mr. Aston a little unsteadily; &#8220;the boy
should have grit in him, Aymer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did they say of the boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah.&#8221; Mr. Aston resumed his seat with a sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s your own impression, Aymer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am satisfied.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Aston leant forward with a wealth of affection
in his kind eyes, and straightened the edge of the gorgeous
sofa cover. &#8220;Aymer, old chap, you are too
sensible, I know, to imagine it is going to run easily
and smoothly from the first. The boy will come out
all right: he is young enough to shape, and worth
shaping. But he has had everything against him except
one thing. It means many troubles and disappointments
for you, but I believe it will have its
compensations. It will help fill your life, at least.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; said Aymer, steadily. &#8220;I should
like to tell you just how I feel about it, father. Putting
aside entirely the question of it being&mdash;Christopher&mdash;. That
was a stroke of Providence, shall we
say? I had you and Nevil, and the children. Life
was not altogether empty, sir. But I felt I had learnt
something from life,&mdash;from myself,&mdash;mostly from
you,&mdash;that might be useful to a man. Not to pass
this on,&#8221; the steady voice lost its main quality for a
moment, &#8220;seemed a waste. I told you all this when I
first spoke of adopting someone; and at that precise
moment the clue which led us to Christopher was put
into our hands. There was no choice then. I say
this again because I want you to remember that the
idea that first started my plan is still the main one.
Christopher, being Christopher, does not alter it.
There is only this thing certain,&#8221; he raised himself a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
very little on his right arm and laid down his cigarette
deliberately, &#8220;I&#8217;ve taken the boy and I mean to do my
best by him, but he is mine now. If the fate that&mdash;she
died to save him from&mdash;comes to him, it must come.
I will not stand in his way, but I will have no hand
in bringing it to pass, I will raise no finger to summon
it, nor will I call him from it, if it come. Until, and
unless it comes, he is mine. I think even she would
let me have him on those conditions.&#8221; He lay back
again, his flushed face still witnessing to the force of
his feeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;On any conditions,&#8221; said his father, &#8220;if she knew
you now. Only you must bear the chance in mind in
dealing with him. And it&#8217;s only fair to tell you the
Union Master&#8217;s report on him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairly docile, but inclined to argue the point.
Truthful,&mdash;I discovered that myself&mdash;but either
through lack of training or&mdash;according to the Master&mdash;through
bad training in London, he is&mdash;&#8221; Mr. Aston
stumbled over a word, half laughed, and then said,
&#8220;well, he has a habit of acquisitiveness, shall we call
it? When you think of her history it seems at once
natural and strange. They had not known him to actually
take things&mdash;money, that is,&mdash;but if he found
any&mdash;and he appears to have luck in finding things&mdash;he
was not particular to discover the real owner. It
may be a difficulty, Aymer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hereditary instinct,&#8221; said Aymer a little shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my own theory is that acquisitiveness is generosity
inverted,&#8221; concluded Mr. Aston thoughtfully,
&#8220;and that heredity is merely a danger signal, though
it may mean fighting. I believe you can do it, my dear
boy, but it is a big job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so, I was a born fighter, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have not done badly that way, son Aymer,&#8221;
returned his father quietly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You mean you have not. You are very gracious
to a vanquished man, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was one of his rare confessions of his indebtedness
to his father, and perhaps Mr. Aston was more
embarrassed at receiving it than Aymer in confessing
it. For the indebtedness was undeniable. The Aymer
Aston of the present day was not the Aymer Aston of
the first bitter years of his imprisonment. The fight
had been a long one: but whether the love, the patience,
the forbearance of the elder man had regenerated the
fierce nature, or whether he had only assisted the true
Aymer to work out his own salvation was an open
question. Certainly those dark years had left their
mark on Mr. Aston, but, for a certainty they were
honourable scars, and he, the richer for his spent
strength. He had sacrificed much for him, but the reward
reaped for his devotion was the knowledge that
of their friendship was woven a curtain of infinite
beauty that helped to shut away the tragedy of Aymer&#8217;s
life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>
<p>The question that chiefly occupied Mr. Aston&#8217;s mind
during the first days of Christopher&#8217;s advent was
whether Aymer had gathered in those ten long years
of captivity sufficient strength of purpose to set aside
once and for all the sharp emotions and memories the
boy&#8217;s presence must inevitably awake.</p>
<p>When Aymer had first approached him on the subject
of adopting a boy he had consented willingly
enough, but when, coincident with this, Fate&mdash;or Providence&mdash;had
pointed out to them the person of Christopher
Hibbault, he, Mr. Aston, though he agreed it
was impossible to disregard the amazing chance, had
sighed to himself and trembled lest the carefully
erected edifice of control and endurance that hedged
in his son should be unequal to the strain.</p>
<p>But after the first evening Aymer Aston betrayed
by no sign whatever that the past had any power to
harm him through the medium of little Christopher,
and his father grew daily more satisfied and content
over the wisdom of their joint action. They stayed
in town all that summer. Mr. Aston was acting as
Secretary to a rather important Commission and even
when it was not sitting he was employed in gathering
in information which could only be obtained in London.
Nothing would induce Aymer to go away without
his father. He hated the publicity of a railway
journey even after ten years of helplessness, and the
long drive to Marden Court could not be undertaken
lightly. So they stayed where they were, a proceeding
which seemed less strange to Christopher than to
such part of the outside world who chose to interest
itself in Mr. Aston&#8217;s doings.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>The August sun dealt gently with the beautiful garden,
and not a few hardworking men, tied, like Mr.
Aston, to town, congratulated themselves on his presence,
when they shared its restful beauty in the hot
summer evenings.</p>
<p>Christopher meanwhile adapted himself to his new
life with amazing ease. He accepted his surroundings
without question, but with quiet appreciation, and if
certain customs, such as a perpetual changing of
clothes and washing of hands were irksome, he took
the good with the bad, and accommodated himself to
the ways of his new friends resignedly. But he was
haunted with the idea that the present state of things
would not and could not last, and it was hardly worth
while to do more than superficially conform to the
regulations of the somewhat monotonous existence.</p>
<p>Most of the ten years of his life had been spent
under the dominant influence of a devoted woman.
All that he had learnt from mankind had been a cunning
dishonesty that had nearly ruined his own small
existence and indirectly caused his mother&#8217;s death.
Women, indeed, had always been near him, and there
were times when he thought regretfully of Mrs. Moss.
There were none but menservants at Aston house, and
the only glimpse of femininity was afforded by the
flying visits of Constantia, Mr. Aston&#8217;s married daughter.
She would at times invade Aymer&#8217;s room, a vision
of delicate colourings and marvellous gowns.
She was a tall, dark, lovely woman who carried on the
traditional family beauty with no poverty of detail.
She seemed to Christopher to be ever going on somewhere
or returning from somewhere. He liked to sit
and watch her when she flashed into the quiet room,
and spent perhaps half an hour making her brother
laugh with her witty accounts of people and matters
strange to Christopher. She was kind to the boy, when
she remembered him, lavish with her smiles and nonsense
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
and presents, but it was like entertaining a rainbow,
an elusive, shadowy thing of beauty. She could
not be said to denote the Woman in the House. Christopher,
as he wandered about the big silent rooms and
long corridors, was perforce obliged to take with him
for company a more shadowy presence, an imaginary
vision of another woman, also tall and dark, but without
Constantia Wyatt&#8217;s irresponsible gaiety and dazzling
smile. He would escort this phantom Woman
through his favourite rooms, pointing out the treasures
to her. He even apportioned her a room for herself,
behind a closed door at the end of the wing opposite
to which Aymer Aston lived. For it was here he had
first discovered with what ease the image of his dead
mother fitted into the surroundings he had never shared
with her. It was rather an uncanny, eerie idea, and
had Christopher been at all morbid or of a dreamy
disposition it might have been a very injudicious fancy:
but he was the personification of good health and robust
spirits. His vivid imagination flitted as naturally
and easily round the memory of his dead mother
as it rejoiced in the adventures of the Robinson family,
or thrilled over the history of John Silver. It was
just a deliberate fancy that he indulged in at will, and
the only really fantastical thing about it was that he
invariably started his tour with the imaginary Woman
from the door of the closed room. At the end of October,
when he had fairly settled into the regular routine
of Aston House, a tutor was procured for him.
School, for more reasons than one, was out of the
question. Christopher&#8217;s previous existence would
hardly have stood the inquisition of the playground,
and Aymer, moreover, wanted to keep him under his
own eye. The boy&#8217;s education had been of a somewhat
desultory nature. He could read and write, and
possessed a curious store of out-of-the-way knowledge
that would upset the most carefully prepared plan of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
his puzzled tutor. That poor gentleman was alternately
scandalised by the boy&#8217;s ignorance and amazed
at his appetite for knowledge. He showed an astonishing
aptitude for figures while he evinced a shameful
contempt for history and languages. Indeed, he could
only be made to struggle with Latin Grammar by Aymer&#8217;s
stories of Roman heroes in the evening and the
ultimate reward of reading them for himself some
day.</p>
<p>The year wore on, ran out, with the glories of pantomime
and various holiday joys with Mr. Aston.
Christopher by this time had accepted his surroundings
as permanent, with regard to Mr. Aston and Aymer,
though he still, in his heart of hearts, had no belief
that so far as he was concerned they might not any
day vanish away and leave him again prey to a world
of privations, wants and disagreeables generally.</p>
<p>He was forever trying to make provision against
that possible day, and laid up a secret hoard of treasure
he deemed might be useful on emergency. With the
same idea he made really valiant attempts to put aside
a portion of his ample pocket-money for the same purpose,
but it generally dwindled to an inconsiderable
sum by Saturday. Aymer kept him well supplied and
encouraged him to spend freely. He was told again and
again the money was given him to spend and not to
keep, and that the day of need would not come to him.
He would listen half convinced, until the vision of
some street arabs racing for pennies would remind
him of positive facts that had been and therefore might
be again, and cold prudence had her say. But this
trait was the result of experience and not of nature,
for he was generous enough. Not infrequently the
whole treasury went to the relief of already existing
needs outside the garden railings, and he could be
wildly extravagant. Aymer never questioned him.
He sometimes laughed at him when he had wasted a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
whole week&#8217;s money on some childish folly, and told
him he was a silly baby, which Christopher did not
like. However, he found he had to buy his own experiences,
and he soon learnt that no folly however
childish annoyed &#8220;C&aelig;sar&#8221; so much as accumulated
wealth for no particular object but a possible future
need.</p>
<p>Christopher had christened Aymer &#8220;C&aelig;sar&#8221; shortly
after his introduction to the literary remains of one,
Julius, from some fanciful resemblance, and the name
stuck and solved a difficulty.</p>
<p>In the same manner he bestowed the distinctive
title of St. Michael on Mr. Aston, from his likeness to
a famous picture of that great saint in a stained glass
window he had seen, and it also was generally
adopted.</p>
<p>No one made any further attempt to explain his introduction
into the family, or the general history of
that family. He was just &#8220;grafted in,&#8221; and left to
discover what he could for himself, and he certainly
gathered some fragmentary disconnected facts together.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is a Secletary?&#8221; demanded Christopher one
day from the hearth-rug, where he lay turning over old
volumes of the <i>Illustrated London News</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;A Secretary, I suppose you mean. A Secretary
is a man who writes letters for someone else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who does St. Michael write letters for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He used to write letters for the Queen, or rather
on the Queen&#8217;s business. What book have you got
there?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a picture of him. Only he hasn&#8217;t got
grey hair: and underneath Perma n-e-n-t, Permanent
Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs. What
does it mean, C&aelig;sar?&#8221;</p>
<p>C&aelig;sar, otherwise Aymer, considered a moment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Permanent means lasting, going on. You ought
to know that, Christopher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he isn&#8217;t going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He could have done so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t he? Didn&#8217;t he like it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, very much. He was trained for that kind of
thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he get tired of writing letters, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer was apt to become monosyllabic when a certain
train of thought was forced on him. Also a short
deep line of frown appeared under the white scar: but
Christopher had not yet learnt to pay full heed to
these signs: also he had a predilection for getting at
the root of any matter he had once begun to investigate,
so he began again:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t he go on being permanent, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He thought he had something else he ought to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was the Queen angry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer cut the leaves of the book he was trying to
read rather viciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Taking care of me,&#8221; he said shortly.</p>
<p>Christopher got up on his knees and stared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you got Vespasian then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good heavens, Christopher, are you a walking inquisition?
My father gave up his appointment&mdash;if
you must know, because of my&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; he stopped, and
went on doggedly, &#8220;of my accident. I wasn&#8217;t particularly
happy when I found I had to stay on a sofa
all the rest of my life, and he had to teach me not to
make an idiot of myself. Now you know all about it
and need not bother anyone else with questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher thought he knew very little about it,
but he had learnt what he set out to know and was
moreover now aware that the subject was distasteful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
to Aymer, so he politely changed it. &#8220;Robert&#8217;s brother
has got some very nice guinea-pigs,&#8221; he said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is Robert?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Robert is the under footman. I forgot you don&#8217;t
know him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher recollected with momentary embarrassment
Aymer&#8217;s inaccessibility to the general domestic
staff.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wants to find a home for them,&#8221; he added
hastily; &#8220;he doesn&#8217;t mind where, so long as it&#8217;s a happy
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer guarded a smile. Christopher was already
notorious for ingenious methods of getting what he
wanted.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a pity for them to be ill-treated, of
course,&#8221; he agreed gravely.</p>
<p>Christopher shuffled across the floor to the side of
the big sofa.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather a happy home here, you know,&#8221; he remarked
suggestively, touching Aymer&#8217;s arm tentatively
with one finger.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad you think so. Do you consider the
atmosphere equally suitable for guinea-pigs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like them.&#8221; He rubbed his cheek caressingly
on Aymer&#8217;s hand. &#8220;May I, C&aelig;sar?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to keep in your bedroom as you did the bantam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But in the garden&mdash;or yard. <i>Please</i>, dear C&aelig;sar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ridiculous baby, yes. If you make a house
for them yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher flew off in a transport of joy to consult
with Vespasian, who, from mere tolerance of his
beloved master&#8217;s last &#8220;fad,&#8221; had become the most
ardent if unemotional partisan of the same &#8220;fad.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Vespasian who had provided Christopher
with more clothes than he deemed it possible for one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
mortal boy to wear, who taught him how to put them
on, and struggled with him figuratively and literally
over the collar question. Vespasian&#8217;s taste running
to a wide margin of immaculate white closely fastened,
while Christopher had a predilection for a free and
open expanse of neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at Mr. Aymer,&#8221; pointed out the great general&#8217;s
successor sternly. &#8220;You never see him with
even a turn-down collar, and he lying on his back all
the time, when most gentlemen would consider their
own comfort.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher, hot, angry and uncomfortable, wondered
if Vespasian had insisted on the wearing of
those instruments of torture, or if C&aelig;sar really preferred
it.</p>
<p>But in spite of small differences of opinion, Vespasian
and he were good friends, and he received much instruction
from the mouth of that inestimable man. It
was he who drilled him in Mr. Aymer&#8217;s little ways,
warned him how he hated to be reminded of his
helplessness, and could not endure anyone but Vespasian
himself to move him from sofa to chair, and
that only in the strictest privacy. How he disliked
meeting anyone when wheeled from his own room to
the dining-room for dinner, which was the only meal
he took in public, and that only in company with his
father or very intimate friends. How he avoided asking
anyone to hand him things though he did not
object to unsolicited help, which Christopher soon
learnt to render as unostentatiously as Vespasian himself.
Also it was Vespasian who explained to him
woodenly, in answer to his direct question, that the
scar on Mr. Aymer&#8217;s forehead was the result of a
shooting accident. His revolver had gone off as he
was cleaning it, said Vespasian, had nearly killed him,
had left him paralysed on one side, so he&#8217;d never be
better. He added, Mr. Aymer didn&#8217;t like it talked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
about. All this and more did the boy learn from this
discreet man, but never did Vespasian hint at those
dark years when to serve poor Aymer Aston was a
work for which no money could pay, when the patient
father and much-tried man had secretly wondered
whether that fight for mere life that had followed on
the ghastly accident had indeed been worth the winning.
There was no word of this in Vespasian&#8217;s revelations.
He only impressed on Christopher the necessity
of avoiding any expression of pity or commiseration
with the paralysed man, and a warning that a
somewhat casual manner towards the world, and his
entirely undemonstrative way, was no true index of
Mr. Aymer&#8217;s real feelings.</p>
<p>Christopher was himself warm-hearted and given to
expressing his joyous feelings with engaging frankness.
It could hardly have been otherwise, brought
up as he had been by a woman of ardent nature and
passionate love for him, but in contradiction to this
he had learnt to be very silent over the disagreeables
of life and to keep his own small troubles to himself,
so that he readily entered into Aymer&#8217;s attitude towards
his own misfortune, and the relationship between
the two passed from admiration on Christopher&#8217;s
part to passionate devotion, and from the region of
experimental interest on Aymer&#8217;s part to personal uncalculated
affection, and to an easing of a sharp heartache
he had tried valiantly to hide from his father.
Aymer never questioned him on the past, never even
alluded to it. Partly because he hoped the memory of
it would dwindle from the boy&#8217;s mind, and partly for
his own sake. But Christopher did not forget. There
were few days when he did not contrast the old times
with the new, and gaze for a moment across the big
gulf that separated Christopher Aston from little Jim
Hibbault and the quiet woman absorbed in a struggle
for existence in an unfriendly world. He occasionally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
spoke of his mother to Mr. Aston when they were out
together, but he kept his implied promise faithfully
with regard to Aymer and made no mention of his
former experiences, or of his mother, until one day
an event occurred which recalled the black terror under
whose shadow they had left London, and necessitated
an elucidation of knotty points.</p>
<p>There was in one corner of the garden far away
from the house a gap in the high belt of shrubs that
jealously guarded the grounds from the curious passerby.
In fact the gap had once meant a gateway, but
it had been disused so long that it had forgotten it
was a gate and merely pretended it was part of the
big railings; only it had not got a little wall to stand
on. Christopher was fond of viewing life from this
sequestered corner. The road that ran by was a main
thoroughfare&mdash;an ever-varying picture of moving
shapes. One morning as he stood there counting the
omnibuses&mdash;he had nearly made a record count&mdash;his
attention was attracted by a small boy about his own
age or possibly older, who was dawdling along, hands
in pockets, with a dejected air. He appeared to be
whistling, but if he were, without doubt it was also a
dejected air. His was a shabby tidiness that spoke of
a Woman and little means. He had sandy hair and
light eyes and&mdash;but Christopher did not know this&mdash;an
uncommonly shrewd little face and a good square
head, and as he passed by the boundaries of Aston
House he glanced at the small fellow-citizen gazing
through the railings&mdash;rather compassionately, be it
said&mdash;for he knew for certain the boy inside was longing
to get through the gate. That one glance carried
him beyond the gate, but he suddenly spun round on
his heel, collided with an indignant lady laden with
parcels, and stared hard at Christopher. Christopher
stared hard at him. Then the boy outside went on his
way.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Jolly like Jim,&#8221; he ruminated, &#8220;but a swell toff,
I reckon. Poor little kid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher, after one shout as the boy went on, tore
back through the garden towards the entrance gate,
meaning to intercept him there. Such at least was his
laudable intention, but half way there his pace slackened;
he stood irresolute, kicking a loose stone in the
gravel path, and finally strolled off to the stable yard
to feed his guinea-pigs.</p>
<p>He was preoccupied and thoughtful for the rest of
that day. Mr. Aston was absent, and when evening
came and Christopher was still a prey to harassing
ideas he decided he must appeal to C&aelig;sar even at the
cost of disregarding Mr. Aston&#8217;s prohibition. He
came to this decision as he lay in his usual position on
the hearth-rug and was goaded thereto by the approach
of bed time.</p>
<p>&#8220;C&aelig;sar, could anyone be taken to prison for something
he had done ever so long ago&mdash;I mean for&mdash;for
stealing, and things like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if he had not been already tried for it. Why
do you ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if anyone met the person suddenly who had
done something would they have to give him up?&#8221;
persisted Christopher.</p>
<p>Aymer regarded him curiously. He had an unreasonable
impulse to check the coming revelation, as
he might the unguarded confidence of a weak man,
but common-sense prevailed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would depend on circumstances entirely, and the
relationship of the two. Are you wanted, Christopher?&#8221;
he asked in a matter-of-fact tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was,&#8221; returned Christopher slowly. &#8220;That&#8217;s
why we left London, you know. It was Marley Sartin.
He took me out with him. You see,&#8221; he broke off
parenthetically, &#8220;I stayed with Martha, that&#8217;s Mrs.
Sartin, all the day while mother took care of a gentleman&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
house, and sometimes Marley was there, and
he taught me things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What things?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher shifted his position a bit, and tossed a
piece of wood into the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, lots of things,&#8221; he repeated at last, &#8220;tricks,
and how not to answer, and how to avoid coppers and
how to get money. Mother said it was stealing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The scar on Aymer&#8217;s forehead was very visible. He
took up a paper-knife and ran his fingers along the
edge slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy looked round, suddenly aware of where he
was, of the beauty and comfort around him, of C&aelig;sar&#8217;s
personality, and the incongruity of his admission.
However, so it was: facts were facts: it was imperative
he should know his own position, even if it was
an unpleasing subject. So he went on hastily. &#8220;Oh,
well, one day he took me out with him for a walk.
We went into a big sort of shop with lots of people
buying things and he knocked up &#8216;accidental like&#8217;
(this was evidently a reminiscence of a phrase often
used), against a lady and she dropped her parcels and
purse and things, and I pretended to pick them up, and
if there were only parcels or pennies I really did, but
if the money spilt and it was gold I put my foot on
it and picked it up for Marley when I could. We made
a lot that way. Of course mother didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; he
added hurriedly, &#8220;or Martha. Then one day there
was a row and Marley was caught, and I ran away.
You see I was pretty small, and could slip in anywhere.
I got back and told Martha, and she cried and told
mother, and said as how I should be sure to be took
too. So we went away from London that night. I
don&#8217;t know what happened to Martha, but mother said
I mustn&#8217;t go back to London or I&#8217;d be taken too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The grim tragedy of it all, the miserable fate from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
which the woman had fought so hard to save her child,
and the same child&#8217;s dim appreciation of it struck
Aymer with the sharpness of physical pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marley told me it was only keeping what one
found, but mother said it was just stealing, and that
Marley was bad. He was good to me anyhow.
Martha&mdash;Mrs. Sartin&mdash;you know&mdash;used often to cry
about Marley&#8217;s ways. <i>She</i> was always very respectable;
her father kept a linen-draper&#8217;s shop, and she
meant to put Sam into a shop. Sam didn&#8217;t like his
father. I saw Sam go by to-day&mdash;he&#8217;s bigger, but it
was him and he knew me&mdash;and I asked about the being
taken up because I thought it wouldn&#8217;t be safe for me
to go about perhaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>So level and even was his voice that Aymer did not
guess the agony of apprehension and fear the boy was
holding back behind his almost abnormal self-control,
but he did his best to reassure him.</p>
<p>&#8220;They would not know you, Christopher, and if
they did they would not take you away from me. You
were a very little boy then. I could let them know
how it happened, and how it could never happen
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher hid his face in his arms and the room
became very silent. The fire crackled cheerfully and
strange shadows lived uncertain lives on the ceiling.
Aymer put the paper-knife down at last and looked at
his charge. He was aware it was a critical moment
for them both: also he was quite suddenly aware he
was more fond of the child than he had previously
imagined. But mostly in his mind was the sickening
appreciation of what hours of torture that solitary
silent woman must have endured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christopher, old boy, come here,&#8221; he said quietly.</p>
<p>The boy got up. His face was flushed, hot with
his efforts to control himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want the light, C&aelig;sar?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, I want you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He came unwillingly and sat down on the edge of
the sofa, playing with a piece of string.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need not be frightened at all,&#8221; said Aymer.
&#8220;It is all utterly impossible now, we both of us know
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know it. You only did what Marley told
you to do. You didn&#8217;t steal because you wanted money
yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Christopher was doggedly truthful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marley used to give me some for myself, C&aelig;sar,
and I liked it and I didn&#8217;t think it was stealing. It was
just keeping what one found.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you knew to whom it belonged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not certain sure, Marley said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did your mother say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just that it was stealing. She said, too, lots of
people in the world were thieves who didn&#8217;t know,
and Marley was no worse than many rich men, who
just knocked people down to get the best of them.
What did she mean, C&aelig;sar?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She thought it was as wrong for a rich man to
take advantage of a poor man, as for a strong man
to attack a weak one, or a cunning man to cheat a
simpleton.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher was conscious he had heard something
like this before. He nodded his small head sagely.
Aymer went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;It really means you must never get money at someone
else&#8217;s expense. If you can give them something
in return, something equal, it&#8217;s all right, but it must be
equal. That is what your mother believed, and I do
too&mdash;now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher regarded C&aelig;sar thoughtfully. He was
speculating what he did in return for the golden sovereigns
that seemed so plentiful with him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We try to give fair exchange,&#8221; explained C&aelig;sar,
answering his thoughts. &#8220;The money comes to us out
of the big world. And my father gives the world good
service in return. You will know how good, some-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does everybody do things?&#8221; sighed his listener,
much perplexed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone should. You are wondering what I do.
My money comes to me before I earn it, from houses&mdash;land&mdash;I
have to see the people who live in my houses
have all that is fair and necessary, that the land is in
order. Then sometimes we lend other people our
money, and they find work for many others, and make
more of it. Money is a very difficult thing to explain,
Christopher. What I want you to remember now is
that you must never take money from other people
without giving something in return, because it&#8217;s stealing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher, with his usual disconcerting shrewdness,
found an unsatisfactory point.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t do anything for the money you give me
every week, C&aelig;sar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer was fairly caught, and wanted desperately to
laugh, only the boy&#8217;s face was so grave and concerned
he did not dare. He thought for a moment to find
a way out of the difficulty without upsetting the somewhat
vague theories he had just crystallised into
words.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I owe something to the world, and you are a
small atom of the world, Christopher, so I choose to
pay a mite of my debt that way. Besides, it is a part
of your education to learn how to spend money, as
much a part as Latin grammar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher thought it a much pleasanter part and
looked relieved.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad you aren&#8217;t paying me,&#8221; he said slowly;
&#8220;of course it&#8217;s just my good luck that it happened to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
be me you pay your debts to. Lots of people aren&#8217;t
lucky like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which was a truth that remained very deeply indented
in Christopher&#8217;s mind. Aymer ordered him
to bed, but when he said good-night he kept grip of
his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why wouldn&#8217;t you like me to pay you?&#8221; he demanded,
almost roughly.</p>
<p>The boy got red and embarrassed, but Aymer waited
remorselessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do anything,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and if I did I&#8217;d
hate you to pay me like that. Some day I&#8217;ll have to
pay you, won&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should hate that worse than you would,&#8221; returned
Aymer shortly. &#8220;There&#8217;s no question of
money between us. I get all I want out of you. Go
to bed.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>
<p>Marden Court lay bathed in the mellow October sunshine.
Late Michaelmas daisies, fuchsias, and milky
anemones stood smiling bravely in the borders under
the red brick walls, trails of crimson creepers flung a
glowing glory round grey stone pillar and coping, and
in the neighbouring woods the trees seemed to hold
their breath under the weight of the rich robes they
wore. Marden looked its best in late autumn. The
ripeness of the air, the wealth of colour, and the harmonious
dignity of the season seemed a fit setting to
the old Tudor mansion, with its reposeful beauty just
touched with renaissance grace. The glory of the
world passes, but it is none the less a glory worth
observing.</p>
<p>The Astons regarded Marden as the metropolis of
their affections. It was &#8220;Home&#8221; and any member of
the family wanting to go &#8220;Home&#8221; did so regardless
of who might be in immediate possession. Nevil
Aston, his wife and two small children and his young
sister-in-law lived there permanently, but their position
was that of fortunate caretakers, and both the elder
Aston and the Wyatts went to and fro at their will.</p>
<p>Nevil Aston was at thirty-two a brilliant essayist
and rising historian, and there was a magnificent library
at Marden which he professed to find useful in
his work. He also was wont to say &#8220;Marden was an
excellent place in which to work, but a far better place
in which to play.&#8221; He himself did both in turn. A
few weeks of furious energy and copious achievement
would be followed by weeks of serene idleness from
which little Renata, his wife, would arouse him by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
sheer bullying, as he himself expressed it, driving him
by main force of will to the library, setting pen and
paper to hand and then placidly consenting to weeks
of irregular meals, of absent-minded vagaries, a seeming
indifference to her presence, in place of the wholly
dependent lovable boyish Nevil of the days of indolence.</p>
<p>It was not till the second autumn after Christopher&#8217;s
introduction to the m&eacute;nage that the senior
Astons decided to desert London for a few months and
go &#8220;Home.&#8221; Mr. Aston had been to and fro not infrequently
and Nevil Aston had made a few brief visits to
town, when Constantia Wyatt had made it her business
to see that her gifted brother did not hide his
light under a bushel, but little Christopher failed to
connect either Nevil or his beautiful sister very closely
with his own particular Astons. They were a part of
an outside existence with which he was unacquainted,
and Marden Court was to him but a name, an unreal
place that got photographed occasionally and that Mr.
Aston seemed to like. The Astons, probably quite unconsciously,
pursued their usual course of leaving
Christopher to drift into the stream of their existence
without any explanation or attempt to make that existence
a clear cut and dried affair to him. He was
pleased enough with the idea of the change, once he
had ascertained his guinea-pigs might accompany him,
and was still more pleased when he was told he would
at all events for a time have no lessons to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have plenty to learn though,&#8221; Aymer had
remarked drily when he made the announcement.
Christopher refrained from asking for an explanation
with difficulty.</p>
<p>Towards the middle of October Nevil Aston, just
in the midst of a period of blissful laziness, sauntered
down the long walks of the south garden in Renata&#8217;s
wake, occasionally stopping to pick up one or other of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
the two fat babies who struggled along after their
mother, interrupting more or less effectually the business
on which she was engaged. A pathetic-eyed yard
or so of brown dachshund and a tortoise-shell kitten
completed the party. Renata Aston was small and
dark, gentle and deliberate of movement, and possessing
an elf-like trick of shrinking her entrancing personality
into comparative invisibility that bereft one
of further vision. She moved from border to border
choosing her flowers with care, and looking even
smaller than she was in the proximity of her lanky
husband, and the plump little babies toddling after.</p>
<p>Presently she came to a stop. All her satellites
stopped too. She regarded her trophies critically.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is very good for the end of October, you
know.&#8221; She remarked to all the assembled court.
&#8220;I only want some violets now. Nevil, I wish you&#8217;d
stop Charlotte picking the heads off the fuchsias: there
are no more to come out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil hoisted his small daughter on his shoulder as
the safest way to avoid an altercation and humbly asked
if he must pick violets, &#8220;they grow so low down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You grow so far up,&#8221; she retorted scornfully.
&#8220;Max can help me. You can watch with Charlotte.
You are very good at watching people work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not a common virtue,&#8221; pleaded Nevil,
&#8220;watchers generally tell the workers how to do it. I
never do. Why don&#8217;t you tell a gardener to pick them,
Renata?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A gardener! For Aymer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All this trouble for Aymer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a pleasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know just how it will be,&#8221; he complained mournfully,
&#8220;the moment Aymer is here you will hound me
off to work and I shall see nothing of you at all. You
won&#8217;t even give me new pens. Charlotte, I should look
horrid if I had no hair: be merciful.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>Renata smiled and shook her head. &#8220;I shall get
no more work out of you this side of Christmas, sir.
I have no such impossible dreams. Perhaps Aymer
won&#8217;t want either of us now he has got Christopher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder now,&#8221; remarked Nevil, depositing Miss
Charlotte on a seat while he took out his cigarette
case, &#8220;I wonder if you are jealous, Renata.&#8221;</p>
<p>She flushed indignantly and denied the fact with
most unnecessary emphasis, so her husband told her
in his gentle teasing way. He turned her face up
to his and professed to look stern, which he never
could do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Confess now,&#8221; he insisted. &#8220;Just a little jealous
of Christopher?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she admitted, laughing and still pink,
&#8220;Aymer has never stayed away from us for so long
before. I don&#8217;t know what was the use of his having
those rooms done up for himself if he never means to
use them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Renata continued to pick violets, and Max to decapitate
those he could find. The dachshund and kitten
continued to watch with absorbing interest, and
Nevil continued to smoke and to let Charlotte investigate
his cigarette case till her mother turned round
and saw her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You dreadful child!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;Nevil, just look.
Charlotte is sucking the ends of your horrid cigarettes!
How can you let her?&#8221;</p>
<p>Charlotte was rescued from the cigarettes, or the
cigarettes from Charlotte, with considerable difficulty
and at the cost of many tears. Indeed her protestations
were so loud that nurse appeared and bore her
and Max away and silence again reigned in the warm
garden between the sunny borders.</p>
<p>The dachshund gave a sigh and flopped down on the
path, and the kitten began a toilet for want of better
employment. Renata, who had stood aside during the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
small domestic storm, gazed at her violets gravely as
if she were counting them.</p>
<p>Nevil watched her contentedly and did not observe
the trouble in her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevil,&#8221; she said at last, &#8220;about Charlotte I wonder&mdash;do
you think&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; she stopped and edged a little
nearer her husband and slipped her hand in his.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think, do you, Nevil, that Charlotte is&mdash;is
getting like Patricia?&#8221;</p>
<p>He put his arm round her and drew her down on
the seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;You dear silly child, no,&#8221; he said, kissing her.</p>
<p>She seemed only half assured and leant her head
against him, sighing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is quite, quite different,&#8221; he insisted. &#8220;Charlotte&#8217;s
temper is just like anyone else&#8217;s, yours or mine,
or anyone&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yours&mdash;you haven&#8217;t got one,&#8221; she returned with
pretended contempt and then lapsed back into her
troubled mien, &#8220;but I feel so frightened sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear, be reasonable. Patricia&#8217;s temper isn&#8217;t a
temper at all. It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s a possession&mdash;a wretched family
inheritance. She can&#8217;t help it, poor child, any more
than she could help a squint or a crooked nose, and
she doesn&#8217;t inherit it from <i>your</i> mother but only from
your step-father, so why on earth you should imagine
it likely to crop up in our family I can&#8217;t conceive. It&#8217;s
absurd.&#8221;</p>
<p>He tilted her pretty face up to his again and kissed
her. Nevil would like to have killed all his wife&#8217;s
cares with a caress. It is not always a successful
method, but it is more efficacious than the world believes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I know all that, though Patricia always
seems quite like my own sister. I do hope Christopher
won&#8217;t tease her.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Aymer will see to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not unless he is reminded. You know he rather
loves teasing the poor darling himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is the poor darling, herself. Storm over,
I suppose, sky serene.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little girl coming down the path to them was
barely twelve, but she looked older. The features were
too set, if anything, too regular for her to be called
pretty as yet, but an observer must have been very
blind to beauty not to see the possibilities shadowed
in her face. She had quantities of smooth gold hair,
one plait of which, for convenience&#8217;s sake, was twisted
round her little head that was at present too small for
its rich burden. Her great dark grey eyes and long
lashes had a curiously expectant look as if ever on the
watch for some joy or pain to come. In the clearness
of her complexion and the good modelling of her little
white hands, she did resemble her half-sister, but it
was the only likeness between them. She came to them
not running, as a child should, but slowly and deliberately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Patricia, do come and hear what this dreadful
Nevil has let Charlotte do,&#8221; cried Renata, still under
shelter of her husband&#8217;s long arm. For some reason
she seemed anxious to let the child know she was seen
and wanted. Nevil smiled and made room on the seat
for her to sit by his side.</p>
<p>Patricia stood in front of them, her great pathetic
eyes looking from one to the other. She finally addressed
herself to Nevil.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ever so sorry, Nevil,&#8221; she said with a dejected
sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, of course, it&#8217;s all right, child,&#8221; he answered
hastily, &#8220;come and hear my short-comings.
I&#8217;m in deep disgrace.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat down obediently and the dachshund immediately
shifted its quarters and wedged itself in between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
her feet. She leant forward with her elbows
on her knees and gazed absently at the brown
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you been doing, Nevil, darling?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I? Not I, but Charlotte. Don&#8217;t you know by
this time, Patricia, I&#8217;m only a scapegoat for the autocrat
of the nursery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He let Charlotte nibble a cigarette,&#8221; explained
Renata.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of my very best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It might have been one of his worst, Rennie,&#8221;
suggested Patricia consolingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are all &#8216;worst&#8217; for Charlotte,&#8221; cried Renata
springing up. &#8220;I must go and put up my flowers
or they&#8217;ll be here before I&#8217;m ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>She flitted away in the direction of the house. Her
husband looked after her with mute sorrow at his
own incapacity to melt from vision in that intangible
manner&mdash;from situations that were too difficult.</p>
<p>He glanced at his little companion, who was making
attempts to tie the dachshund&#8217;s ears round his own
neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t be able to treat Christopher that way,
Patricia,&#8221; he said contemplatively, &#8220;but it will be
jolly for you to have a companion of your own age,
won&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he won&#8217;t like me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is quite likely to like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, at first, because I&#8217;ll make him,&#8221; she returned
with engaging candour, but then her mouth
drooped a little, &#8220;but when he knows what I&#8217;m really
like, he won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil examined another cigarette carefully to see it
had not been nibbled. He was really very fond of his
little sister-in-law though occasionally at a loss how
to deal with her strange moods.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we are all very fond of you, anyway, child,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
he said easily; &#8220;as for the temper, you can&#8217;t really
help it, you know, and you&#8217;ll grow out of it. I&#8217;m
sure you try to, my dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t try,&#8221; cried poor Patricia wildly, &#8220;I
haven&#8217;t time, I don&#8217;t know anything about it till it&#8217;s
there and then it&#8217;s too late. I might just as well have
flung that plate at Charlotte as at you to-day. I wonder
Renata lets me go in the nursery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no. You wouldn&#8217;t be angry with a baby.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned to him with a sort of exasperated patience.
&#8220;That&#8217;s just it. You don&#8217;t any of you understand.
It does not make any difference, why, who or
where. It just comes. I <i>can&#8217;t</i> help it.&#8221; She kicked
her heel on the gravel fiercely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor little Patricia,&#8221; said Nevil gently. &#8220;I can
only say we all love you just the same, and I believe
you&#8217;ll grow out of it.&#8221; She changed suddenly and
flung herself into his arms in a wild transport of tears
and childish abandonment. He was in no wise taken
aback and soothed her with adroitness born of practice.
When she was calm again he sat with his arm
round her talking of indifferent things till a clock
somewhere near struck three.</p>
<p>&#8220;They should be here directly,&#8221; he said, but made
no effort to rise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would Aymer really mind being met?&#8221; she
questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d rather be left to Vespasian and Tollens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tollens was the old butler.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t he ever get used to it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is afraid of becoming an invalid if he gets
hardened to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he is, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it. He has perfectly wonderful
health. He has massage and all sorts of things to keep
him up to the mark. Aymer&#8217;s as vain as a girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t call it vanity. I call it pluck.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>Nevil groaned, &#8220;Oh, you women, old and young!
But you are right&mdash;and there are my father and Christopher
himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher to his great joy had been allowed to
drive down with Aymer and Mr. Aston, and had
found the journey not one mile too long. Indeed towards
the end his early curiosity as to the termination
had evaporated and the mile-stones had come in sight
and vanished all too quickly. It had been reassuring
to find Vespasian awaiting them at the door with the
old butler to whom he was formally introduced as Mr.
Aymer&#8217;s ward. Then having inquired of Tollens of
the family&#8217;s whereabouts, Mr. Aston bore off Christopher
for further introductions.</p>
<p>At the entrance to the garden on the long terrace
and by the gate leading to the south garden he had
paused and looked round with the slow comprehensive
glance of one acquainted with every detail. He spoke
nothing of his thoughts to Christopher, but the boy
was quite acutely aware that Mr. Aston loved this
place and was happy to see it again, while he calmly
discussed the possibilities of fishing in the lake that lay
below like a silver mirror in the clear sunlight.</p>
<p>And in the south garden Nevil and Patricia met
them. Patricia, still white and shaken with the past
storm, greeted Mr. Aston shyly, but had no qualms
about greeting Christopher. He, for his part, was far
too shy and too unused to girls&#8217; society to notice her
mien. He did, however, remember afterwards that
she was standing by a great clump of purple starlike
flowers and that he thought her the most beautiful
thing he had ever seen, excepting, of course, Constantia
Wyatt. He made that mental reservation as they
walked along together in front of their elders, and
then glancing sideways at the wonderful hair again,
decided he liked fair hair best. Constantia&#8217;s was dark.
They soon outdistanced the two men who followed at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
a leisurely pace. Mr. Aston looked after them and
said kindly:</p>
<p>&#8220;The little girl still gives trouble, I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Occasionally.&#8221; Nevil made the admission with
reluctance. &#8220;There was a scene this morning. I
don&#8217;t know what started it. Perhaps I teased her.
She flung a plate at me. I don&#8217;t believe she <i>can</i> help
it, poor child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t tell her so, Nevil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d tell her anything you could if you saw her
after. She&#8217;ll grow out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so.&#8221;</p>
<p>They fell to talking of the estate, which Nevil was
supposed to look after. He did, when he remembered
it, but that was not often, and not of late. His father,
half exasperated, half laughing, told him he would defer
his lecture till later on. Nevil penitently agreed it
was only fitting to do so, and slipping his arm through
his father&#8217;s, began to explain to him the rights of a
controversy just started in the <i>Historical Review</i>. No
one was ever angry with Nevil long. His unchangeable
sweet temper and gentle judgment of mankind,
his entire lack of vanity and the very real ability that
was concealed under his elusive personality outweighed
the exasperation his irresponsibility and indolence
sometimes awoke. He had no enemies among
those who knew him, and the bitterest controversy
with pen and ink could be brought to a close in an interview.
It must, however, be confessed that with pen
in hand Nevil was more dangerous than the unwary
might imagine. He knew his power with that weapon
and when he chose to use it, did so to good purpose
with a polished finish to his scathing periods, that made
men twenty years his senior hate with fierce passion
Aston the writer, as surely as they would end by appreciation
of Aston the man after a personal encounter.</p>
<p>Patricia and Christopher having outdistanced their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
elders proceeded to make friends in their own way.
The girl began operations by asking if he would like
to see the stables and found it aroused no enthusiasm
in him, which was a point to the bad. But he was
polite enough to say he would like to go if she wished
it, which nearly equalised matters again. She confessed
it might be nice to have someone to play with,
which Christopher thought very friendly of her, and
told her of his guinea-pigs, which would arrive in the
evening with Robert and the luggage. That was distinctly
a point to the good; they both waxed eloquent
over the special qualities of guinea-pigs. Christopher&#8217;s
original two had already increased alarmingly
in numbers. He hinted some might even be left at
Marden&mdash;in a good home. Also he told her he had
christened the family by the names of great painters.</p>
<p>&#8220;C&aelig;sar taught me the names,&#8221; he explained,
&#8220;there is Velasquez&mdash;he painted the Don Carlos in
C&aelig;sar&#8217;s room, you know&mdash;he&#8217;s brown all over except
for one spot&mdash;<i>my</i> Velasquez, I mean&mdash;and there&#8217;s
Watteau&mdash;an awful frisky little beast&mdash;and Sir Joshua,
who sleeps in my pocket. You&#8217;ll like Sir Joshua, he&#8217;s
awfully good tempered.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; nodded Patricia wisely, &#8220;and he painted
Nevil&#8217;s great grandmother. It&#8217;s in the drawing-room.
Why do you call Aymer &#8216;C&aelig;sar&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he always does what he means to do, or
gets it done; besides he is&mdash;just C&aelig;sar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t bad,&#8221; she said condescendingly, &#8220;perhaps
I shall call him so myself. I do hope we are going to
have tea in his room. It&#8217;s such a lovely, lovely room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it is in London. The beautifulest room I&#8217;ve
seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just as nice here,&#8221; she maintained stoutly, &#8220;he
planned how it was to be done, and Nevil saw to it.
I like this best.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher was too polite or too shy to insist, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
he felt doubtful and became impatient to see for himself,
so they went indoors to find Patricia&#8217;s hopes were
justified. Tea was served in &#8220;Mr. Aymer&#8217;s&#8221; room.</p>
<p>And Christopher was obliged to allow that Patricia
had some ground for her statement. It was
a smaller room than the one in London, and singularly
like it, only the prevailing note was lighter and gayer
in tone. Aymer was there, lying on a similar sofa
to his usual one, with the familiar cover across his
feet.</p>
<p>Renata was making tea, and making C&aelig;sar laugh
also. Christopher was uncomfortably conscious it
was all new to him and the familiarity only superficial,
while it was a well-recognised phase in C&aelig;sar&#8217;s
life. Even Nevil Aston seemed a different person in
his easy country dress, and Christopher failed at first
to connect the dark little lady at the tea table with him,
and only noted she took Aymer his tea, which was his,
Christopher&#8217;s, special privilege, and treated him with
a friendly familiarity that nearly bordered on contempt
in Christopher&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>Aymer saw the children and called to them. Patricia
greeted him with the air of a young princess
and drew herself up when he said she had grown, and
would soon be a child instead of a baby. Then he
faced Christopher round towards Renata, who had
suddenly become grave and shy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is Christopher, so you can approve or condemn
Nevil by your own judgment, Renata. Christopher,
shake hands with Mrs. Aston.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher did as he was told, but he realised they
had been speaking of him and felt on the defensive.
However, he sat down as near to C&aelig;sar as he could.
They talked of all manner of people and things of
which he knew nothing, traditional jokes cropped up,
and Aymer&#8217;s propensity for teasing asserted itself in
a prominent manner. Renata never failed to respond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
and never failed to claim Nevil&#8217;s protection and to look
delightfully shy and dignified and feminine. Presently
the children were sent for. To Christopher&#8217;s indignant
amazement they were plumped down on Aymer
and allowed to treat him much as if he was a
new species of giant plaything. Charlotte, in her efforts
to burrow under Aymer&#8217;s arm, rolled off the edge
of the sofa and was deftly caught by Christopher, who
deposited her on the floor. She immediately tried to
clamber up again, but Aymer could not second her
efforts with his left arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put her up again, Christopher,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But Christopher apparently did not hear, and Mr.
Aston, who had been watching, came to the rescue.
Christopher slipped away to the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;A question of a third baby, I think,&#8221; said Mr.
Aston softly as he rearranged Charlotte, and Aymer,
looking sharply at Christopher, laughed.</p>
<p>When Christopher went to bid him good-night, he
found C&aelig;sar alone, looking tired and doing nothing,
not even reading.</p>
<p>Christopher said good-night gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not very late,&#8221; remarked Aymer. &#8220;Stay
with me a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>He patted the chair beside him. Christopher with
rather a hot face obeyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you like Marden?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know yet. There seems to be a lot of
people here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s home, you see. We all come home when we
want to see each other and have people round.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose everyone wants to see their people
sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you like seeing people?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any of my own,&#8221; said Christopher, without
looking at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s unkind. You have us.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>Christopher changed the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do those&mdash;those little children live here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s their home. They are rather jolly little
kids. What&#8217;s the matter, Christopher?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher assured him nothing was the matter.</p>
<p>Aymer continued in his most matter-of-fact voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fond of those babies. To begin with they are
Nevil&#8217;s and they are the only youngsters I am likely
to know well. But I&#8217;m a greedy person. I had Nevil,
Renata, the kiddies&mdash;and that delightfully odd Patricia,
and it wasn&#8217;t enough for me. They were all as
good as could be to me, but I wanted to be more than
an extra in someone&#8217;s life, so I must needs encumber
myself with a troublesome little boy who&#8217;s even more
greedy than myself, apparently.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher sat with his curly head on his hands
trying not to give in to the smile that was struggling
to express some undefined sense of content which had
sprung to life.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a bad, silly boy to be jealous,&#8221; said Aymer,
watching him, half laughing, half affectionately,
&#8220;you ought to have known for yourself, if they had
been enough for me, you wouldn&#8217;t be here at all.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>
<p>Two events wrote themselves indelibly on Christopher&#8217;s
memory in connection with this first visit to
Marden, while the one great matter that began there
and influenced his whole after life merged itself into a
general hazy sense of happiness and companionship.
For it is given to few of us even when we have reached
years of discretion to recognise those moments in our
lives which are of real, supreme, and eternal importance:
moments when the great doors of experience
open slowly on silent hinges and we pass in, unconscious
even that we have crossed the threshold. But
all that happens to our familiar selves, that touches
our well-known emotions, and rubs or eases the worn
grooves of existence, is heavily underscored in our
recollection, and not infrequently we take for mile-stones
on the way what were but pebbles on the road.</p>
<p>The two events which Christopher carried in his
memory were, however, not unimportant, for both
bore on his relationship with the man who was moulding
his life. The one episode turned Vespasian&#8217;s bald
statements into real emotional facts, and the other was
the first serious collision between the far-off disastrous
tutelage of Marley Sartin and the new laws of existence
as propounded by Aymer Aston.</p>
<p>Christopher&#8217;s education made vast strides during
that winter. The season proved an unusually mild
one. He was out the greater part of each day with
Patricia, enduring with remarkable fortitude her alternate
contempt and despair over his ignorance of such
everyday matters as horses, guns, dogs, desert island
games, and such like. When she laughed at him for
not being able to ride he shut his teeth hard not to
remind her he&#8217;d never possessed a shetland pony from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
birth as she had, also he rose at an unconscionable
early hour and rode in the cold winter&#8217;s dawn round
and round the exercising yard with the young grooms,
while Patricia was warm and fast asleep in bed. But
he had his reward when Mr. Aston, who had heard of
his doings from the stud-groom, took him out with
him on one of his rounds of inspection to outlying
farms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The boy&#8217;s got a good seat, and pluck, Aymer,&#8221;
reported Mr. Aston. &#8220;It&#8217;s more creditable to him
because he has had to learn. It&#8217;s not second nature
to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>It took him less trouble to learn how to handle a
gun, and when &#8220;off duty&#8221; to Patricia, spent a vast
amount of time in the electric plant house, learning
the A B C of a big dynamo.</p>
<p>Aymer knew all this and made no mention of lessons,
for Christopher was backward in more matters
than booklearning and the life on a big estate, the infinite
variety of interests was all good food for the
boy&#8217;s hungry brain and soul.</p>
<p>He grew apace. Mr. Aston declared he was a
changeling and not the thin little urchin he had first
encountered by the mile-stone on the Great Road.
They never alluded to his life before that, though they
all knew of it, and made their own private comparisons
and observations.</p>
<p>Christopher became quite attached to the babies so
long as they did not intrude on his own particular
hours with C&aelig;sar, but he did not get over a certain
shy reserve towards Renata.</p>
<p>&#8220;She slips into empty places,&#8221; he said to C&aelig;sar
once, and C&aelig;sar laughed at him and told Renata, who
coloured and wrinkled her little forehead.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a nice boy,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I love him for
being so good to Patricia. There hasn&#8217;t been a storm
since he came.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>One day, when it was too wet for even Christopher
to be out, the two children amused themselves by turning
out a cupboard in a disused room. It was a perfect
stronghold of treasures. Old riding whips, Badminton
Magazines (marked Aymer Aston, Christopher
noticed), tennis balls, cricket pads, a pair of fencing
foils and mask and gloves, a host of sporting trophies
from a hare&#8217;s pad to a wolf&#8217;s ear labelled &#8220;Kronigratz,&#8221;
and last of all a box full of photographs.</p>
<p>Patricia was called away before they could investigate
this last treasure trove, and Christopher, not to
be alone in the glory of discovery, carried it off to
C&aelig;sar&#8217;s room and lay on the hearth-rug enjoying it till
C&aelig;sar, busy working out estate accounts for his father,
was at liberty to look too. They were interesting
photographs,&mdash;to a boy. Mostly of horses ridden,
led, alone, jumping, horses galloping, horses trotting,
and over and over again a picture of one horse, and
rider, who never seemed to wear a hat and had a thick
head of hair that looked as if it might be the same colour
as C&aelig;sar&#8217;s. At last he came to a bigger, more
distinct photo of the same man and horse. The horse
was evidently a polo-pony and was galloping and the
man on it in white riding things, with his shirt open
at the neck and was swinging a polo stick in his hand.
There was no mistaking it this time: it was undoubtedly
C&aelig;sar. Christopher gave a little gasp.
C&aelig;sar like that, vigorous, active, panting,&mdash;Christopher
could feel it so&mdash;with life and excitement. He
scrambled to his knees with the picture in his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;C&aelig;sar, dear C&aelig;sar, look what I&#8217;ve found.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer looked round, saw the scattered photographs,
and held out his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it you really? May I have it for myself?&#8221;</p>
<p>C&aelig;sar took the card and as he gave it up, Christopher
knew he had made a mistake, and got
scarlet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you find it?&#8221; demanded Aymer
sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the cupboard in the little red room. We were
turning it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s I. Why shouldn&#8217;t it be? I wasn&#8217;t always
a cripple, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>He tossed the picture back on the rug. The scar
stood out white and distinct, and his face was strangely
hard and set. A book slipped down on the left side
and he tried to catch it with the left hand and failed,
and it fell with a bang on the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I have it?&#8221; asked Christopher meekly from
the rug.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for? You don&#8217;t know the horse and you
don&#8217;t know the man. Put it in the fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t,&#8221; exclaimed Christopher indignantly.
&#8220;C&aelig;sar, don&#8217;t be so horrid, it&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s&mdash;exactly like
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>C&aelig;sar ignored his own command and asked another
question instead. &#8220;Where did you say you found
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a cupboard in the little red room. It&#8217;s such a
jolly little room. It isn&#8217;t used now and there&#8217;s hardly
anything in it, but the cupboards are full of things&mdash;lovely
things. Patricia and I just explored.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It used to be my room and the things are all mine.
Why haven&#8217;t they burnt them?&#8221; he muttered.</p>
<p>Christopher gathered up the unlucky photographs
and put them back in the box. He was dimly conscious
he did not want Mr. Aston to come and see
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, C&aelig;sar, I didn&#8217;t know we shouldn&#8217;t have
done it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t done any harm, I&mdash;I had no business
to be cross, old fellow. Come and show me the pictures
again, I&#8217;ll tell you about them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher sat down on the sofa with the box in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
his hand. He really did want to know about them if
C&aelig;sar wasn&#8217;t going to be angry. He took out a photo
at random.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was my first race-horse,&#8221; said C&aelig;sar. &#8220;Her
name was Loadstar. She didn&#8217;t win much, but I
thought a lot of her. And that&mdash;oh, that&#8217;s a mastiff
I had: he was magnificent, but such a brute I had to
kill him. He went for one of the stable boys and I
hardly got him off in time. I&#8217;ve got the marks now
of his claws: he never bit me. We used to wrestle
together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wrestle with a dog?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I used to be fairly strong, you know, Christopher.
It was good training throwing him&mdash;sometimes
it was the other way. But he had to die, poor old
Brutus.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you kill him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shot him,&#8221; said C&aelig;sar shortly, &#8220;don&#8217;t ask for
morbid particulars. Where is another picture?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This?&#8221;</p>
<p>This was a photo of a horse standing alone in a
field and beneath was written, &#8220;Jessica waiting to be
tamed.&#8221; Aymer offered no explanation,&mdash;if Christopher
had looked he would have seen the scar show up
again sharply over a frown.</p>
<p>The next was rather a wicked snap-shot of Aymer
cover shooting, with what looked suspiciously like a
dead fox curled up at his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a wretched little cub I had tamed,&#8221; he explained,
&#8220;the little beast used to follow me everywhere.
It&#8217;s really tied up to a tree, but it always lay
out as if dead when it heard a gun. I took it out
with me to try and get it used to the sound.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a picture of Aymer and Nevil riding and
coming over a big water jump side by side.</p>
<p>Aymer told him it was at the Central Horse Show
and related the triumphs and honours of the day.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>But when the polo photograph turned up again
Aymer appeared tired of the amusement, and sent
Christopher off to meet his father in the brougham at
Maidley station, four miles distant. &#8220;If someone
doesn&#8217;t go he&#8217;ll be reading reports and working out
figures till he arrives at the door,&#8221; said Aymer. &#8220;It&#8217;s
disgraceful not to know how to take a holiday properly.
It&#8217;s only small boys who ought to work like
that,&#8221; he added severely.</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t given me any work to do, C&aelig;sar,&#8221;
protested Christopher, but C&aelig;sar only laughed.</p>
<p>When the boy had gone, however, Aymer continued
to turn over the photographs. It was an extremely
unwise proceeding, for each of them called him with
irresistible voice back to the past from which he had
sworn he would turn his eyes. It was always there
with its whispering, mocking echo, but like a good
fighter he had learnt to withstand its insidious temptations,
and hold fast to the quiet, secure present
where all he could know of joy or fulfilment was centred.</p>
<p>But there it was, the great gulf that lay between
him and the past, in which were swallowed up the
hopes, ambitions, expectations of his vigorous youth,
and all the possibilities of a man&#8217;s life. He had fathomed
it to its blackest depth, and seen no hope of
escape or rescue. And yet he had escaped, through
the devotion and courage of his father. And it was
the ever-living recollection of that devotion that helped
him to keep his face turned from the other side of the
gulf. Only on rare occasions did his strength of purpose
fail him, and by some momentary carelessness he
found himself caught back into a black hour of bitterness
and helpless anger.</p>
<p>There was no one to blame but himself, no power
to accuse but his own headlong passion, and the imperious
impatience that would take no gift from life
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
but that of his own choosing. There had been a
woman and a tangle of events, and his passion-blinded
eyes could see no way of disentangling it, and yet how
trivial and easy the unravelling appeared now. The
quick&mdash;not resolve&mdash;but impulse that caught him on
the crest of his uncontrolled, wild temper, and
prompted the shot that missed its intention by a hairs-breadth:
the whole so instantaneous, so brief a hurricane
of madness, succeeded by the long pulseless stillness
of this life of his now.</p>
<p>To do, and not to be able to undo, to hunger and
thirst and ache to take back only a short minute of
life, to feel sick and blind before the irretrievableness
of his own deed, that was still his punishment in these
rare hours of darkness.</p>
<p>He had fought for life at first with all that virile
strength of his and won this limited existence which,
when he first understood its cruelly narrow horizon,
he had as ardently longed and sought to lose again,
but the life principle that had been so roughly handled
was marvellously tenacious, and refused to be
ousted from its tenement. Slowly and painfully Aymer
had groped his way from desolate despair to something
higher than mere placid resignation, to a brave
tolerance of himself and an open heart to what life
might still offer him.</p>
<p>There was, however, little toleration in his heart
at this hour as he lay staring at the photograph, and
then suddenly looked round the room he had made so
beautiful for himself. It was just as usual, every detail
complete, satisfactory, balanced, redeemed too
from its own beauty by its strange freedom from detail
and its emptiness.</p>
<p>It pleased him well as a rule, but this evening that
same emptiness seemed to emphasise his own isolation.
He was suddenly conscious of a sense of incompleteness,
of some detail left out that should be there&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
want he could not measure or define. It was a
sort of culminating point in his own grey thoughts.
In a gust of his old imperious temper he caught up
the photograph and tore it in half, and flung it from
him: tried to fling into the fire and failed even in that.
The box of photographs fell and scattered on the floor.
He turned his head sharply and hid his face in the
cushions.</p>
<p>It was very quiet in the room, the fire burnt steadily,
and outside the dusk had already fallen. There
was a very little knock at the door, but he did not
hear it; the door opened with a breath of fresh cold
air and a faint scent of violets as Renata entered.</p>
<p>She saw she was unobserved, saw his attitude, and
her whole being seemed to melt into an expression
of longing compassion. Nevil or his father would
have gone away unseen in respect for his known
weakness, but Renata for all her shyness had the
courage of her instincts.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I come and warm myself, Aymer? You
always have the best fire in the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not move for a moment.</p>
<p>Renata knelt by the fire with her back to him and
took off her long soft gloves, her bracelets making a
little jangling sound. Then she saw the torn picture
and picked it up and shook her head disapprovingly.
The overturned box lay nearer the sofa. She picked
that up too, and began replacing its contents in a
matter-of-fact way.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t possibly see things in this light,&#8221; she
remarked. &#8220;It is getting quite dark. Do you want
a light, Aymer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Aymer abruptly, turning so that he
could see her.</p>
<p>She sat down in a big chair the other side of the
hearth and began chatting of the very serious At
Home she had just attended in Winchester.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>The black mood slipped from him, and with it the
sense of need and incompleteness. It had melted as
snow before a fire the moment he had heard the swish
of her dress across the floor, and the breath of violets
reached him. He forgot even to be ashamed of his
own passing weakness as he watched her. She was
all in brown with strange beautiful gold work shining
here and there. She had flung back her furs and
there was a big bunch of violets in her dress. He
watched her little white fingers unfasten them as she
talked.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they would not think they were amusing themselves,
I could endure it,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but they solemnly
pretend it&#8217;s amusement and frivolous at that.
One old lady told me gravely, she hardly thought it
seemly that the Dean should so lend himself to the
pleasures of the world. There, the violets are not
spoilt at all. The Dean gave them to me: it&#8217;s the one
thing he can do&mdash;grow violets. You shall have them
all to yourself.&#8221; She fetched a silver cup and began
arranging them. Aymer ceased to be tired, ceased to
be anything but supremely content as his eyes followed
her. She went on relating her experience until
she had made him laugh, and then she came and sat
on a little stool near him.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I have the babies down?&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer pretended to grumble.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll go to them if I say no,&#8221; he complained,
&#8220;so I have no option.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bell was rung and the babies ordered to
descend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before they come, C&aelig;sar, I&#8217;m going to ask you
a favour,&#8221; she said coaxingly, &#8220;now you are in a good
temper again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was I in a bad one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dreadful. It mustn&#8217;t reoccur. It is such a bad
example for the children.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The favour, please; bother the children.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;C&aelig;sar, I&#8217;m ashamed of you. Bless them, you
meant to say. Well, the favour. Aymer, I am going
to start a cr&ecirc;che in Winchester near the big clothing
factory. I&#8217;ve talked to the Bishop and he quite approves.
I know just the house, but I shall have to
buy it, and I haven&#8217;t enough money for that. I can
run it easily if I can only get the premises. What
will you subscribe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any money at all,&#8221; he replied gravely.
&#8220;Vespasian takes it all and I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;d approve
of cr&ecirc;ches, not being a family man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Vespasian, indeed.&#8221; She tilted her chin in the
air as Aymer meant her to do, a trifle too much, and
the effect was spoilt, but he was well practised in obtaining
the exact tilt he admired.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can ask him, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very likely I will: in the meantime what will you
give me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Half a crown. No; five whole shillings, if I have
it,&#8221; he said teasingly.</p>
<p>She considered the matter gravely. &#8220;I am not
quite sure. I should not like to inconvenience you.
Shall we say four and six?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I will be generous. I&#8217;ll do this. If you will
take the risk of being accused of burglary by Vespasian,
I happen to know there is some money in the
right hand drawer of the table over there. I don&#8217;t
know how much. Fivepence, perhaps, but you shall
have whatever it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Renata walked with great dignity across the room
and opened the drawer. A little smile hovered about
her lips. She picked up a handful of gold and silver
and sat down by him to count it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks an awful lot,&#8221; he remarked anxiously.
&#8220;Won&#8217;t you let me off? Vespasian is always complaining
of my extravagance.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sh&#8211;&#8211;Sh&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; she held up one finger, &#8220;ten,
eleven, twelve, and two and six, that&#8217;s thirteen,&mdash;no,
fourteen and sixpence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave me the sixpence,&#8221; he urged plaintively, but
she continued counting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven pounds, four shillings and sixpence. Count
it yourself, Aymer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer counted and gravely pronounced her arithmetic
to be correct.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, you are a dear.&#8221; She piled the coins
up neatly in little piles on the table by her side. He
told her she had better put it in her pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t one,&#8221; she sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will be sure to forget it, and then Vespasian
will get it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it likely I would forget seven pounds, four shillings
and sixpence?&#8221;</p>
<p>But she did. The children arrived and rioted over
Aymer. Master Max bumped his head and had to be
consoled with his uncle&#8217;s watch, while Charlotte wandered
off on a voyage of exploration alone, and finally
sat on the floor by the window with her fat legs
straight out in front of her, making a doll of one arm
by wrapping it up in her dress, and singing to herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;She has quite an idea of time already: listen to her,
Aymer.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Aymer only scoffed at his niece&#8217;s accomplishments,
and then Nevil came in and went down
on his knees to kiss his wife, who was much too occupied
with her son and heir to move for him. For a
moment all three heads were on a level, and it was
only when the long Nevil stood up and Renata was
reaching up on tip-toe to put some of the violets in
his coat that Aymer&#8217;s sense of completeness vanished.
Finally the children were carried off and he was alone
again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lucky thing for me,&#8221; he said to himself
steadily, &#8220;that Nevil married Renata: he might just
as easily have married someone I couldn&#8217;t endure.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Christopher and Mr. Aston returned they
found Aymer whistling and drawing ridiculous caricatures
of the family on the back of the <i>Times</i>, and he
was so outrageously flippant and witty that his father
glanced at him suspiciously from time to time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why haven&#8217;t you let Vespasian light up?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid to call Vespasian. Renata has been
raiding and I shall get a lecture. She&#8217;s left her booty,
as I told her she would. Christopher, when you have
quite finished pretending it&#8217;s your duty to draw the
curtains, you might run up with this money to her.
Put it in that box.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher came forward rather slowly. He swept
the money into the box indicated.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a lot,&#8221; he commented.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven pounds, four shillings, and sixpence, and I
am now penniless. I shan&#8217;t even get credit with
Heaven. She&#8217;ll appropriate that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher ran off with it and meeting Nevil on
the stairs gave it into his hand. Renata had gone to
dress, and Nevil sauntered in to his wife with her
&#8220;spoils&#8221; at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven pounds, four and sixpence,&#8221; she said gleefully.
&#8220;For the cr&ecirc;che fund. It was nice of Aymer.
I had not meant to worry him to-day, but he wanted
distraction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought Vespasian kept his money. Six pounds
four and sixpence, Renata,&#8221; Nevil remarked, counting
the money carelessly. She came over to him, brush
in hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t even do addition. Nothing but dates!
I counted it most carefully, so did Aymer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he&#8217;s defrauded you of a pound since.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense.&#8221;</p>
<p>They counted it together, but no amount of reckoning
would make seven sovereigns out of six. The
silver was correct.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have fallen down,&#8221; said Renata at last
and put it away carefully in her desk.</p>
<p>They were late for dinner, and Mr. Aston pretended
to upbraid them and told Renata to take her soup
and leave her correspondence alone, for there was a
big envelope lying by her plate. It was her father-in-law&#8217;s
contribution to the cr&ecirc;che scheme, Aymer having
forestalled her request, and joined forces with
his father in a really adequate sum.</p>
<p>Renata got pink with pleasure as she looked at the
cheque. She was, however, far too shy to express her
real gratitude in words before them all. She smiled
at the donor and remarked she would give him a big
photograph in a beautiful frame of the first baby admitted
to the cr&ecirc;che, to hang in his room as a slight
token of her appreciation of his gift.</p>
<p>&#8220;It shall take the place of Charlotte,&#8221; he assured
her gravely.</p>
<p>Aymer looked aggrieved.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I ask the precise sum, Renata?&#8221; he inquired
pointedly, &#8220;that earns so gracious a reward.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s three figures,&#8221; she answered, regarding the
precious slip of paper affectionately before replacing
it in its imposing envelope.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ninety-two pounds, fifteen and sixpence more,&#8221;
he groaned; &#8220;it&#8217;s a lot for a photograph of a mere
baby, but I can&#8217;t be left out in the cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I can let you have one without a frame
for less, only father&#8217;s must be the best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevil,&#8221; remarked Aymer severely, &#8220;I would call
your attention to the fact that your wife is beginning
to weigh men&#8217;s merits by their means.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil only laughed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I hear she has raided you of all you possess. Six
pounds odd.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven pounds four and sixpence,&#8221; corrected Aymer.
&#8220;I should like the correct sum printed in good
plain figures on your list, Renata. Being my all, it
is a superior present to more pretentious donations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Six pounds four and sixpence, however,&#8221; persisted
Nevil.</p>
<p>Aymer looked up quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you count it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have dropped,&#8221; said Aymer slowly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
send it you with the interest, Renata.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he knew it had not been dropped.</p>
<p>Mr. Aston began telling them of a deputation from
the Friends of the Canine Race he had received that
day, and no more was said on the other matter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>
<p>Although Christopher&#8217;s habit of acquisitiveness had
given Aymer some uneasy moments, yet there had
been so far no very serious conflict of the question
of meum and tuum. Aymer had sought rather to
overwrite the rude scrawl of Marley Sartin than to
erase it. The most serious aspect that had shown
itself hitherto was Christopher&#8217;s readiness to accept
tips from over-generous callers and even to put himself
to ingenious trouble to invite them. Constantia
Wyatt was a great offender in this and brought down
a severe scolding on her own head from her brother
when he at last learnt of Christopher&#8217;s propensity.</p>
<p>&#8220;He does it so neatly and with such a charming,
innocent face,&#8221; pleaded Constantia, half laughing; &#8220;it&#8217;s
no harm, Aymer. All boys like tips: I know my boy
does.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she rather libelled Master Basil Wyatt, who,
though not averse to a donation, would have scorned
to solicit it. Aymer had told Christopher that gentlemen
did not do these things and had taken care to
keep the boy out of the way of departing visitors.
But this had been before his first lecture on the obligations
of money, and Christopher had taken that
lesson to heart and quite outgrown his childish and
perfectly innocent habit of inviting tips.</p>
<p>Aymer was furiously angry with himself for the
quick suspicion which connected the boy with the missing
sovereign. He tried honestly to put it away from
himself as unwarrantable and dangerous. But there
it was, a wretched little poisonous thought, tugging
at his heart, unreasonably coupled with a recollection
of a conversation between Patricia and Christopher
that he had overheard one afternoon at tea-time,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
anent the construction of an amateur brickwork bridge
across an inconvenient stream. Patricia had said
they could buy bricks at the brick-yard, and Christopher
had said he had no money left; it would cost lots
and lots and they must wait till pay-day.</p>
<p>He mentioned the loss of the sovereign to Christopher
and asked if he had dropped the money on the
stairs, and Christopher had composedly answered in
the negative, and had volunteered the remark that if
it had been dropped in the room it could not have
rolled far on the thick carpet. Aymer had been for
the moment convinced of the injustice of his own suspicion.
He made no attempt to discover any other
solution to the problem; rather he evaded what might
prove a difficult task, and contented himself with solemnly
sending Renata a cheque for the remainder
&#8220;with interest,&#8221; and neither Renata nor Nevil spoke
of the matter again, at least to him. Nevil may have
had his own opinions about it, and if he had they
were quite certainly communicated to his wife. The
worrying uncertainty, however, proved too much for
Aymer, and the following evening when he was alone
with his father he told him the story, half hoping to
be scolded for harbouring uncharitable suspicions.
Now, Mr. Aston had been scrupulous to a fault in
avoiding the offer of any suggestions or advice on
Christopher&#8217;s upbringing. He desired above all things
to leave Aymer free in his chosen task, but he realised
at once this was a point where Aymer was quite as
likely to hurt himself as Christopher, and, therefore,
that he, Aymer&#8217;s father, must make an exception to his
rule and he did not like it. He began drawing vague
lines on his shirtcuff with a pencil, an evil habit of
his when uneasy in mind. Aymer watched him with
disapproval.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all our efforts,&#8221; he sighed gravely, &#8220;you
still persist in your old bad ways, sir. How often
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
have I entreated you to remember a poor valet&#8217;s feelings,
and how often has Nevil begged you to recollect
the sorrows of the washerwoman?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Aston laughed and put away his pencil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevil once indited an ode to me entitled &#8216;The
Lament of the Laundress.&#8217; I fear I&#8217;m incorrigible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What displeases you, sir?&#8221; demanded his son after
a little pause; &#8220;it&#8217;s no use pretending there&#8217;s
nothing wrong; you only do that when you want to
say something you think won&#8217;t be acceptable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, Aymer, I say this: Christopher is
your concern. I don&#8217;t doubt your power to manage
him, but I can speak of yourself, and I tell you it&#8217;s a
very bad thing to live with an unsatisfied suspicion;
particularly bad for you. If you don&#8217;t clear this up
you will never feel quite at ease with the boy. It is
so already, is it not?&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer admitted reluctantly that it was indeed the
case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let anything stand between you, Aymer. I
am thinking of you, of course,&#8221; he added hastily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure you are not thinking of yourself?&#8221;
returned his son, half laughing, half ruefully; and his
father flushed a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I was,&#8221; he said humbly. &#8220;It would
worry me if you were not happy with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer laughed outright at that and assured him
he knew how to make allowances for his well-known
selfishness. But he took his advice and grappled with
the difficulty next afternoon. Christopher was mending
a rod, seated on the floor as usual.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve not found that sovereign,&#8221; said C&aelig;sar
abruptly.</p>
<p>Christopher looked up quickly, and then went on
with his work after a brief &#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you take it, Christopher?&#8221;</p>
<p>He asked the question quite slowly and looked at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
the boy, who got scarlet but went on tying his rod
and appeared to be considering the question carefully,
weighing it in his mind as it were, and when he answered,
it was as deliberately as Aymer had questioned
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer felt a sudden sense of relief, for lying had
not been one of Christopher&#8217;s faults. Then almost
immediately he found himself wondering first, why
the boy was not angry, and secondly, why it had taken
so much thought to answer at all. However, he let
the matter drop and told himself he was satisfied.
Christopher finished mending his rod and then sat
still considering deeply. Presently he took out a
penny from his pocket and began rolling it on the
thick carpet, and, as he had remarked to C&aelig;sar, it
did not roll far, try as he would. At last he jumped
up with a satisfied mien and went out. C&aelig;sar heard
him whistling as he went down the passage and felt
easier in his mind. Renata and the babies paid their
usual visit after tea, and Miss Charlotte, after a brief
conversation with her uncle, slid off the sofa and
trotted away to the end window, where she appeared
to be diligently playing hide-and-seek with herself.
Suddenly her elders were startled with a prolonged
cry of anguish and Renata flew to the rescue.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tan&#8217;t find it; naughty mousie taken my booful
golden penny,&#8221; sobbed Charlotte in her mother&#8217;s
arms. Renata could make nothing of her grief and
persisted in thinking that she was hurt, and cuddling
her. Aymer, listening attentively, said suddenly to
Renata in his imperious way:</p>
<p>&#8220;Give Charlotte to me, Renata, and take baby
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Renata obeyed meekly. People had a weak way of
obeying Aymer on occasions, even against their will.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Miss Charlotte,&#8221; said Aymer, when the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
young lady was safely deposited by him, &#8220;tell me
about it. What golden penny was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Charlotte got suddenly red and stopped crying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you playing with it yesterday in the window?&#8221;
asked her uncle.</p>
<p>Charlotte nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it your penny or mine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t nobody&#8217;s, only mummy&#8217;s. You <i>said they</i>
were for her. Charlotte wasn&#8217;t naughty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you find it on the floor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dey was all in nice itty rows on the table. I
only taken one pitty goldy penny. Mummy gives me
goldy pennies always.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sovereigns for playthings, Renata. That&#8217;s very
immoral.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, only new halfpennies. Charlotte didn&#8217;t know
any better, Aymer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you played with it in the window there and
left it there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is I naughty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very naughty&mdash;if you tell me. Did you leave
it there?&#8221;</p>
<p>Charlotte&#8217;s lip trembled. &#8220;I putted it to bed in the
curtain by a mousehole, and it&#8217;s all gone, naughty
mousie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go and see, Renata, if there&#8217;s a hole there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; said Charlotte gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please go and see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer laughed. &#8220;I beg your pardon, Renata.
Please will you mind looking for the mousehole?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tan&#8217;t see the mousehole,&#8221; put in Charlotte, &#8220;I
only &#8217;tend it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Renata looked all the same. There was no
mousehole and no golden penny.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is all right,&#8221; explained Aymer in answer to his
sister-in-law&#8217;s troubled look. &#8220;I know all about it.
Don&#8217;t worry your little head. We will give Charlotte
another golden penny, or a silver one. Only,&#8221; he
added, regarding his small niece severely, &#8220;Charlotte
must not touch anyone&#8217;s pennies again, not mummy&#8217;s
or Uncle Aymer&#8217;s, or anyone&#8217;s. It is not dreadfully
naughty this time, but it would be next time&mdash;<i>dreadfully</i>
naughty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charlotte opened her eyes very wide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you be dreffly angry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and very unhappy. I shouldn&#8217;t let you come
to see me any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that Miss Charlotte flung her arms round his
neck, protesting she wasn&#8217;t naughty and Uncle Aymer
must love her. Peace was at last restored and
Aymer drew pictures of innumerable mice carrying
off golden pennies and only sent the children away
when Christopher came in.</p>
<p>He gave no hint to Christopher that he had solved
the problem of the lost money and discovered the boy&#8217;s
own compromise between truth and dishonesty. He
was anxious to see whether Christopher&#8217;s moral
standard was really satisfied with the same compromise
or not. So he treated him as far as he could in
his natural manner during the next few days, but
found it a little difficult. Fond of Christopher as he
was, this was just one of those points where the enormous
difference between the child of one&#8217;s own self,&mdash;of
self plus the unknown&mdash;and the adopted child of
others, became visible. The fault was so inexplicable
to Aymer, so utterly foreign to his whole understanding,
that he had nothing but contempt for it, whereas,
had Christopher been his own son, love would have
overridden contempt with fear.</p>
<p>Christopher, with his uncanny, quick intuition of
Aymer&#8217;s innermost mind, was not deceived by his ordinary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
casual manner, and became, to Aymer&#8217;s secret
satisfaction, a little suppressed and thoughtful.</p>
<p>It was at this point the boy had his first introduction
to poor little Patricia&#8217;s temper.</p>
<p>The two children had been riding and returned
home by way of the brook over which their ambitious
dreams had already built a bridge. Patricia, who was
in rather a petulant mood, reproached Christopher
rather sharply for having got rid of his last month&#8217;s
pocket money so prematurely. &#8220;Just like a boy,&#8221; she
said, wrinkling her nose contemptuously. She had
five whole shillings left of her money and when Christopher
could double that they were to go to the brick-yard
and bargain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you any at all?&#8221; she questioned impatiently.</p>
<p>Christopher, who was examining the proposed site,
did not answer at once, and she repeated her question.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have some,&#8221; he confessed unwillingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, can&#8217;t we start with that. You said you
hadn&#8217;t any on Monday. How much is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Christopher declined to answer.</p>
<p>Patricia persisted in her point. If Christopher had
<i>any money</i> they could begin the bridge next day.
Christopher said he&#8217;d see about it.</p>
<p>Patricia, much exasperated, said she should go
home, and her companion proposed to make the ponies
jump the brook. She was too angry to answer him,
but she set her pony at it, and the pony, instead of
rising to the jump on command, very cautiously
stepped into the stream and splashed across. It is to
be feared Christopher laughed. Patricia cantered on,
having seen, with much satisfaction, the other pony
behave in precisely the same way. But the end was
not the same. Christopher wheeled the pony round
and tried again, tried eight times and failed and succeeded
at the ninth. It was characteristic of him that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
he did not lose his temper, but had kept on with a
sort of dull, monotonous persistence that must have
been very boring to the equine mind.</p>
<p>Then he galloped after Patricia, and catching her
up at the lodge gates retailed his triumph gleefully.
Perhaps he was a shade too triumphant, for he was
still in disgrace, and she had not spoken. At all
events by the time they had dismounted and were returning
to the house through the garden, she was in
a fever of irritation, and Christopher, blissfully ignorant
of the fact, was just a tiny bit inclined for
private reasons of his own, to emphasise his own good
spirits. He never noticed the clenching and unclenching
of her small hands or saw the whiteness of her
tense averted face, and he began teasing her about
her pony and her weight. &#8220;Nevil must buy you a
brand new one, up to your weight,&#8221; he suggested,
&#8220;you&#8217;ve broken Folly&#8217;s spirit evidently.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was standing on the steps, just one step below
her, and he looked back laughing. On a sudden, with
no word or sound of warning, she turned and cut at
him with her riding whip, her little form quivering
with the grip of the possessing demon. The lash
caught him across the face and he fell back against
the wall gasping, with his hand up. Luckily it was
but a light whip and a girl&#8217;s hand, but the sting of it
blanched him for an instant. The flaming colour died
from Patricia&#8217;s face as suddenly as it had come, and
with it the momentary fury. She stood gazing at her
companion a moment, and when he looked up half
terrified, half angry, she turned quickly and ran down
a grass path, dropping her whip as she went.</p>
<p>Christopher stood still, rubbing his smarting cheek
gingerly, wondering vaguely what he would say if it
showed. He had heard from others as well as from
Patricia herself, of the child&#8217;s fearful paroxysms of
rage and had rather scoffed at it&mdash;to her. But at this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
moment he was far nearer crying, very near it, indeed,
to be strictly truthful. He was really concerned for
Patricia, and also he was a little&mdash;unnecessarily&mdash;ashamed
of his own collapse under the sudden attack.
Probably she thought it worse than it was. He
walked slowly down the grass path between the yew
hedges and picked up the whip as he went. Patricia
was not on the tennis court nor in the summer-house,
nor in the rose-garden, so he turned his steps to the
wilderness, as the rough wooded slopes on the northern
side of the garden were called. He knew her
favourite spots here and presently came on her huddled
up on an old moss-grown stone seat, her head in
her arms. She was quite still, she was not even crying,
and Christopher felt a little frightened. What if
she were still angry like that? However, the chances
were against it, so he went up and sat down by her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Patricia, don&#8217;t be silly,&#8221; he commanded. &#8220;What
did you run off like that for? You didn&#8217;t hurt&mdash;not
much,&#8221; he added truthfully&mdash;he had taken to being
very exact about the truth of late.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go away,&#8221; said Patricia. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you. I
don&#8217;t want anyone. You don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, someone&#8217;s got to understand,&#8221; persisted the
boy in a high-handed way. &#8220;You aren&#8217;t going to be
let get in tempers with me and then sulk about it afterwards.
Don&#8217;t be silly. Sit up.&#8221; Patricia&#8217;s golden
hair lay about her like a veil. He pushed it aside and
tried to pull her hands away from her face, for he
was getting really a little frightened at her manner.
Some instinct taught him that her misery was as exaggerated
and bad for her as her temper, and he was
dimly afraid of leaving her alone, as was the custom
of her little world after one of her outbreaks.</p>
<p>Patricia suddenly sat up. There were black rims
round her great sad eyes already and her face was red
and white in patches from the pressure of her hands.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You said I hadn&#8217;t hurt you,&#8221; she gasped, gazing
at the dull red mark of which <ins class="trnote" title="Transcriber&amp;#8217;s Note: Chirstopher in original text">Christopher</ins> was already
almost unaware.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does it show? What a beastly nuisance. I said
it didn&#8217;t hurt much, Patricia. Not at all now. I&#8217;m
sorry I was such a baby.&#8221; He put his arm round her
and she leant her head against him too exhausted to
care whether he thought her a baby or not.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be jolly exciting having a temper like
that,&#8221; he said, thoughtfully. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be half so
bad if you meant it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat bolt upright and stared at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; she demanded breathlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because if you meant it you could take care <i>not</i>
to mean it, silly. You&#8217;d look out. But you don&#8217;t
mean it. You didn&#8217;t mean to hurt me then till you
did it. It&#8217;s much worse for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew a long breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Christopher dear, how clever you are. No-one
ever understood that before. They all say, &#8216;well,
anyhow, you don&#8217;t mean it,&#8217; as if that made it better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stupid, of course it&#8217;s harder to help what you
don&#8217;t mean than what you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t help it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher gave her a little shake. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be
silly. You will have to help it, only it&#8217;s harder. You
can&#8217;t go on like that when you are big&mdash;ladies don&#8217;t&mdash;none
I&#8217;ve seen. It&#8217;s only&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; he stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Women in the street. At least&mdash;some, I&#8217;ve seen
them. They fight and scream and get black eyes and
get drunk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Christopher, you are hateful!&#8221; She flared up with
hot cheeks and put her hand over his mouth. &#8220;I&#8217;m
not like that, you horrid boy. Say I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say you were,&#8221; said Christopher with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
faint exasperation. &#8220;I said it reminded me&mdash;your
temper. Come along in.&#8221;</p>
<p>She followed very unwillingly, more conscious than
he was of his disfigured face.</p>
<p>And Renata met them in the hall and saw it and
got pink, but said nothing till Patricia had gone upstairs.
Christopher was slipping away too&mdash;he never
found much to say to Mrs. Aston&mdash;and of late less than
ever. However, she stopped him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you been quarrelling, Christopher?&#8221; she
asked deprecatingly with a little tremor in her voice.</p>
<p>Christopher assured her not.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have hurt your face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The branch of a tree,&#8221; he began shamefacedly,
and stopped lamely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>No more was said. Renata was conscious of her
own failure to get on with Christopher, but she put
it down entirely to her own shyness, which interfered
now in preventing her overriding his very transparent
fib in Patricia&#8217;s defence. She went away rather
troubled and unhappy. But Christopher, a great deal
more troubled and unhappy, looked out of the hall window
with a gloomy frown. His own words to Patricia
that she had so sharply resented, about the
women he had seen fighting in the street, had called up
other pictures of the older life, pictures in which Marley
Sartin figured only too distinctly. He felt uncomfortably
near these shifting scenes. Like Patricia, he
wanted to deny the connection between himself and the
small boy following in the wake of the big man
through crowded streets and long vistas of shops. He
did not wish to recognise the bond between little Jim
Hibbault and Christopher Aston. But the pictures
were very insistent and the likeness uncomfortably
clear. At last, with no more show of emotion or will
than if he were going on an ordinary errand, he walked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
slowly down the corridor to C&aelig;sar&#8217;s room. He had
entirely forgotten about Patricia now and was taken
aback by C&aelig;sar&#8217;s abrupt inquiry about the mark or
his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was an accident,&#8221; he said hurriedly, and then
plunged straight into his own affairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;C&aelig;sar, I have something to give you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He held out his hand with a sovereign in it.</p>
<p>C&aelig;sar took it and, after glancing at it casually, put
it on the table, looking hard at Christopher, who got
red and then white.</p>
<p>&#8220;It couldn&#8217;t have been the sovereign you lost,&#8221; he
said earnestly. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t take any of that money,
really, C&aelig;sar. I found this on the floor by the window.
It couldn&#8217;t have rolled all that long way from
here. It must be another.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was pleading with himself as much as with
C&aelig;sar, desiring greatly to keep faith with his own
integrity, though something in C&aelig;sar&#8217;s face was driving
him from his last stronghold.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t ask me if I&#8217;d found a sovereign,&#8221; he
pleaded desperately, &#8220;you asked me if I had taken one
of Mrs. Aston&#8217;s sovereigns, and I hadn&#8217;t, because how
could it have got to the window from here?&#8221;</p>
<p>C&aelig;sar&#8217;s face flushed a dusky red. He spoke in a
hard, constrained voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Charlotte took one of the sovereigns as a plaything
when we were not looking and hid it under the
curtain in the window. To her it was only a toy, but
to you&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>He made a last effort to keep control of his temper
and failed. The storm broke.</p>
<p>&#8220;But to you&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; he repeated with a curiously
stinging quality in his voice as if the words were
whipped to white heat by inward wrath&mdash;&#8220;to you a
sovereign is no toy, but a useful commodity, and your
code of honour&mdash;do you call it that?&mdash;is doubtless a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
very convenient one. It is far too subtle a code for
my poor intellect, but since you appear able to justify
it to yourself it is no concern of mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher stood still and white under this ruthless
attack: all his energies concentrated in keeping
that stillness, but at the back of his mind was born a
dull pain and sharp wonder, a consciousness of the
Law of Consequence by which he must abide, and
henceforth accept as a principle of life. There was too
great confusion in his mind for him to weigh his
instinctive action and subsequent behaviour against
what, to Aymer, was the one and only possible code of
honour. For the present it was enough that in Aymer&#8217;s
eyes that action was mean, despicable and contemptible.
The Law of Consequence he dimly realised
worked from the centre of Aymer&#8217;s being and not
from the ill-trained centre of his, Christopher&#8217;s, individuality.</p>
<p>&#8220;In future,&#8221; went on Aymer, still too furiously
angry to weigh his words or remember they were addressed
to a child, &#8220;if I have occasion to make any
inquiries of you we will have a distinct understanding
as to whether we are speaking with the same code or
not. You can go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher turned blindly away, and was stopped
at the door. &#8220;As for the sovereign, which must be
very precious to you, considering the price you were
ready to pay for it, I will have it pierced and put on
a chain, so you can wear it round your neck. It
would be a pity to lose anything so valuable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher turned with indignant protest in every
line. However Aymer might talk of their separate
codes of honour, he was, nevertheless, dealing out a
punishment adequate to the infringement of his own
code, and to Christopher it appeared unjust and cruel.
For the moment it was in him to remonstrate fiercely,
but the words died away, for such a protest must of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
necessity be based on an acceptance of this divided
code, and to that he would not stoop. It was some
poor consolation to pay the penalty of a higher law
than he was supposed to understand. He turned
again to the door and got away before a storm of tears
swamped his brave control.</p>
<p>When Charles Aston returned that night he found
Aymer in a very irritable mood. Nevil, in his gentle,
patient way, had been doing his best to soothe him,
but in vain. When Aymer was not irritated, he was
bitter and sarcastic, even his greeting to his father
was short and cold. It was clear some event in the
day had upset his mental equilibrium, and Christopher&#8217;s
absence (he did not even appear to say &#8220;good-night&#8221;)
gave Mr. Aston a clue to the situation.</p>
<p>Nevil was wading through a book on farm management,
which bored him considerably. His part
was to read long extracts which Aymer was comparing
with some letters in the &#8220;Field.&#8221; They continued
their employment and Mr. Aston sat down to write a
letter. From time to time he paused and heard Aymer&#8217;s
sharp, unreasonable remarks to his brother. A
memory of the old bad days came so forcibly to Mr.
Aston that he laid aside his pen at last and sat listening
with an aching heart. He knew those quick flashes
of temper were a sign of irritation brought to a white
heat. Presently, after one remark more unjustifiable
than ever, Nevil looked across at his father with a
little rueful grimace, and seeing how grave was Mr.
Aston&#8217;s expression he made another valiant effort to
keep peace and ignore the abuse, and went on reading.
The subject under discussion was the draining of a
piece of waste land, and when the long article came to
an end, Nevil in his dreamy way summed up the matter
by saying it was a very picturesque corner of the
estate and a pity to spoil it.</p>
<p>Aymer flung the papers down violently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all you care for, or are likely to care for,&#8221;
he said brutally. &#8220;I know I might as well let the estate
go to the dogs as try and improve it. Once my
father and I are dead, you&#8217;ll turn it into a damned
garden for your own use.&#8221;</p>
<p>For one second Nevil&#8217;s face was a study in suppression.
He got up and walked across the room, his
hands shaking.</p>
<p>Mr. Aston spoke sharply and suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aymer, pull yourself together. You are taking
advantage of your position. What circumstances do
you imagine give you the right to trample on other
people&#8217;s feelings like this, whenever something or
other has put you out? It&#8217;s outrageous! Keep your
temper better in hand, man.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was so obviously deserved, so terribly direct, and
at the same time so calculated to hurt, that Nevil
turned on his father with reproachful eyes, and then
perceiving his face, said no more.</p>
<p>Aymer became suddenly rigid, and lay still with
waves of colour rising to and dying from his face,
and his hands clenched.</p>
<p>Mr. Aston waited a moment and then said apologetically
and hurriedly, &#8220;I&#8217;m awfully sorry, Aymer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it had to be done,&#8221; responded Aymer, turning
his face to him with a rueful smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m a brute.
Nevil, old fellow, you ought to give him a V. C. or
something; he is positively heroic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be an idiot,&#8221; retorted his father, blushing
for all his fifty-eight years, because of a grain of truth
in his son&#8217;s words. For indeed it sometimes requires
more courage to be brutal to those we love than to be
kind to those we hate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go away, Nevil,&#8221; continued Mr. Aston good humouredly,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll look after Aymer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil departed, with secret relief, the atmosphere
was a little too electrical for his liking.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>When he had gone, Mr. Aston went over to his
elder son and sat on the edge of the sofa.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s really the matter, old chap?&#8221; he asked
gently.</p>
<p>Aymer related the whole history of the sovereign,
Christopher&#8217;s confession and the subsequent events.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say he was quite honest about his point of
view,&#8221; he concluded petulantly, &#8220;but because I could
not see it I lost my temper with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>His father sat thoughtfully considering the carpet.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be a little hard on Christopher,&#8221; he said at
length, very slowly and without looking up, &#8220;if every
time he has the misfortune to remind you of his father
you lose your temper with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer turned sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; went on the elder man steadily, &#8220;I think,
Aymer, it was not only Christopher&#8217;s hazy ideas of
honour and honesty that angered you, but he forced
on your notice the fact that he was his father&#8217;s son,
that he had in him the germs of that quality which
has made his father what he is&mdash;a successful man.
Isn&#8217;t it so?&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer did not answer. It was true, he knew, however
great his wish to disown it. Something of the
self-dissatisfaction that had numbed poor little Christopher
fell to his share. He felt his father was a little
hard on him&mdash;he could not really understand his relationship
to the boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not quite fair on Christopher, is it?&#8221; said
Mr. Aston very gently, &#8220;at least that is how it strikes
me. I do not want to interfere between you, but I do
want you to do yourself full justice in dealing with
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer looked suddenly up at his father and laughed.
&#8220;It is evidently not only Christopher who is in disgrace
to-day,&#8221; he said ruefully. &#8220;I wish I could in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
turn upbraid you with unfairness, but Christopher has
the pull over me there.&#8221;</p>
<p>He held out his hand. It was a great concession in
Aymer to show even this much demonstration of feeling
unasked, and it was appreciated.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might say good-night to Christopher when
you go upstairs,&#8221; Aymer said casually a little later,
and his father nodded assent, by no means deceived
by the indifferent tone. Both Aymer and Christopher
slept the better for his ministrations that night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>
<p>At the end of February the elder Astons returned to
town and Marden Court was no longer mere vague
locality to Christopher, but the &#8220;home&#8221; of those he
loved, the centre piece of their lives, and he had a
share in it himself.</p>
<p>Still he was very happy to find himself back at Aston
House. Its many deserted rooms, the long, silent
corridors and its strange spacious emptiness lent themselves
to his robust imagination more easily than the
living friendly warmth of the old house, brimful of
actualities. He re-explored every corner of house and
garden in the first days of return, interviewed the staff
collectively and individually, from Warren the butler,
to the new scullery boy. He rearranged his books and
hunted up half-forgotten treasures, slid down the shiny
banisters fifty times a day and dispelled the silent
lurking shadows with a merry whistle and a laugh that
woke an echo in quiet rooms. But he regretted
Patricia. It would have been very pleasant to take
his turn at showing her round&mdash;Patricia had only been
in London once,&mdash;and there would have been plenty
to show her. Lessons, however, recommenced almost
at once and Christopher was left with little time for
regrets. Life fell back into its old grooves with the
solitary difference that those grooves seemed deeper
worn and more familiar than he had imagined. The
months no longer only presented possible problems;
he could consult his memory as to what had previously
been at such a time or in like conditions.</p>
<p>He was also given much greater liberty now and
encouraged to go out by himself, and to do errands
for Mr. Aston or Aymer. It was a proud day for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
him when Aymer first sent him to The House with a
letter for Mr. Aston, who was acting secretary on a
Committee at the time. Christopher had had to wait
and had sat outside a Committee room door and
watched men go to and fro, men whose faces were
dimly familiar to a student of illustrated papers, and
men who were strange, but all men doing something
in return for the good things the world had given
them. Such at least was Christopher&#8217;s innocent belief.
Aymer did not disillusion him.</p>
<p>He used to recount his small adventures to C&aelig;sar
in the evenings and was encouraged to form his own
conclusions from what he had noticed and to confirm
existing ideas from actual life. Such conclusions and
ideas were naturally often childish and illogical, but
C&aelig;sar never appeared to find them laughable and
would give careful and illuminating consideration to
the most chaotic theories.</p>
<p>The everlasting problem of riches and poverty, happiness
and misery often came uppermost, and on this
point Christopher was assuredly, but quite unconsciously,
as illuminating to Aymer as Aymer was to
him. There were certain points of view, certain lines
of thought with regard to the attitude of these &#8220;under-world&#8221;
people, which Christopher knew without
knowing how, and which, flashing out unexpectedly,
would dissolve philanthropic theories wholesale. Aymer
would retell them to his father afterwards, who
in turn would bring them out in his quiet, unexpected
way in one of those wonderfully eloquent speeches of
his that made the whole list of &#8220;Societies&#8221; court him
as a dinner guest and speaker, and political coteries
sigh with pained surprise at his refusal to stand for
Parliament.</p>
<p>Christopher, indeed, possessed to a full degree the
power of absorbing the mental atmosphere in which he
lived and of becoming a sort of visible incarnation of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
it. Places and people who had thus once found expression
in him could always bring to the surface
again that particular phase of existence they had originally
stamped on his mind. The Christopher who
wandered amongst the wharfs and warehouses in that
vague region across the river, remembered and was
concerned over quite different matters to the happy
boy who rode every morning in the Row with Mr.
Aston.</p>
<p>There were many people to and fro to Aston House:
Men who were a power in the world; men who would
be so, and men who had been, as well as many of no
note at all. They came to consult Charles Aston on
every conceivable thing under the sun, from questions
of high politics to the management of a refractory
son. They did not always take his advice, nor did he
always offer it, but they invariably came away with
a more definite sense of their own meaning and aims,
and somehow such aims were generally a little more
just, a shade more honest, or a little higher than
they had imagined when they started out. Charles
Aston was still alluded to by men of high repute as
&#8220;the man who might have been,&#8221; yet many there were
who, had they considered it carefully, might have said
to themselves that &#8220;might have been&#8221; was less well
than &#8220;has been.&#8221; Very occasionally he entertained
and Constantia came to play hostess for him. On these
occasions Aymer rarely appeared at dinner, but a few
privileged guests visited him afterwards and kept alive
the tradition that Charles Aston&#8217;s son, that poor fellow
Aymer, was an even more brilliant conversationalist
and keener wit than his father. But as a rule
very few from the outside penetrated as far as the
Garden Wing of Aston House, and Aymer and Christopher
continued to lead a peaceful and uninterrupted
existence there.</p>
<p>Christopher continued to occupy his leisure with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
prodigious number of pets and the construction of
mechanical contrivances for their convenience, in
which he showed no little ingenuity. There were occasionally
tragedies in connection with the pets which
were turned to good account by the master of their
fate even at the expense of his own feelings&mdash;and fingers&mdash;as
on the occasion when he cremated a puppy-dog
who had come to an untimely end. C&aelig;sar objected
to this experiment, and when the next catastrophe
occurred, which was to a guinea-pig, a more commonplace
funeral had to be organised.</p>
<p>But this tragedy became curiously enough linked
with a new memory in Christopher&#8217;s mind, of more
lasting importance than the demise of &#8220;Sir Joshua
Reynolds&#8221; of the brown spots.</p>
<p>It happened this-wise. Sir Joshua having stolen a
joyous but unsafe hour of liberty fell a victim to the
cunning of the feline race. Christopher rescued the
corpse and heaped tearful threats of vengeance on the
murderess, and then tore into C&aelig;sar&#8217;s room to find
sympathy and comfort. He tumbled in at the window
with Sir Joshua in his arms, and flung himself on
C&aelig;sar before he had observed the presence of a visitor&mdash;a
stranger, too. He was a big, florid man, with a
good-natured face and great square chin, and he was
standing with his back to the fire, looking very much
at home. He gave a slight start as Christopher tumbled
in, and a queer little cynical smile dawned on his
face as he watched the two.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hallo, Aymer, I didn&#8217;t know you had&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go and get ready for tea, Christopher,&#8221; interrupted
Aymer peremptorily, &#8220;and take out that animal.
Don&#8217;t you see I have a visitor?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher, who had just perceived the stranger,
hardly disguised his lack of appreciation of so inopportune
a caller, and went out to see what consolation
could be got out of Vespasian. When he returned,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
tidy and clean, even to Vespasian&#8217;s satisfaction, he
found the two men talking hard and slipped quietly
into his seat behind the little tea-table hoping to be unobserved;
but C&aelig;sar called him out of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter,&#8221; he said, &#8220;let me present my adopted son
to you. Christopher, shake hands with Mr. Masters.&#8221;</p>
<p>The big man and the small boy looked at each other
gravely, and then Christopher extended his hand.
Aymer looked out of the window and apparently took
no notice of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your name besides Christopher?&#8221; demanded
the visitor. He had queer, light blue, piercing
eyes that were curiously unexpressive and looked
through one to the back of one&#8217;s head, but, unlike Mr.
Aston&#8217;s kind, steady gaze, that invited one to open
one&#8217;s soul to it, the immediate impulse here was to
pull down the blinds of one&#8217;s individuality in hasty
self-defence, and realise, even in doing it, that it was
too late.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aston,&#8221; said Christopher, rather hastily, escaping
to the tea-table.</p>
<p>Peter Masters looked from him to Aymer with the
same queer smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-looking boy, Aymer,&#8221; he said carelessly.
&#8220;You call him Aston?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve given him our own name,&#8221; said Aymer
steadily, &#8220;because it saves complications and explanations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A very wise precaution. What are you going to
do with him eventually?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly know yet. What were you saying about
the strike?&#8221;</p>
<p>They fell to discussing a recent labour trouble in the
Midlands, and Christopher gathered a hazy notion
that their visitor employed vast numbers of men who
were not particularly fond of him, and for whom he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
had not only no affection, but no sort of feeling whatever,
except as instruments of his will.</p>
<p>Christopher was very glad he was not one of them;
he felt rather hostile to the big, careless, opulent man
who spoke to Aymer with a familiarity that Christopher
resented and had already apparently forgotten his
own small existence.</p>
<p>The forget was but apparent, however, for presently
he turned sharply to the boy and asked him if he
had ever been down a coal mine. Christopher, putting
control on his own hot curiosity to explore the
subject, answered that he had not, and gave Mr. Masters
his second cup of tea without any sugar to emphasise
his own indifference to the questioner, who unfortunately
never noticed the omission, but drank his tea
with equal satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever been over an iron foundry?&#8221; persisted Mr.
Masters, with the same scrutinising gaze.</p>
<p>C&aelig;sar was playing with his favourite long tortoise-shell
paper-knife; he seemed unusually indifferent to
Christopher&#8217;s manners, nor did he intervene to save
him from the string of sharp questions that ensued.</p>
<p>Christopher made effort to answer the questioner
with ordinary politeness, but he was not communicative,
and Mr. Masters presently leant back in his chair
and laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Young man, you&#8217;ll get on in the world,&#8221; he said
approvingly, &#8220;for you&#8217;ve learnt the great secret of
keeping your own counsel. I prophesy you&#8217;ll be a successful
man some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher was not at all elated at the prospect.
He was wondering why Aymer drank no tea, also
wondering how long the visitor meant to stay. There
seemed no sign of departing in him, so Christopher
asked if he might go and bury the guinea-pig with
Vespasian&#8217;s help. Aymer nodded permission without
speaking.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A cute lad,&#8221; remarked Mr. Masters; &#8220;what are
you going to do with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Put him in the iron trade. &#8217;Prentice him to me.
There&#8217;s something in him. Did you say you didn&#8217;t
know who his father was?&#8221; He shot one of his quick
glances at Aymer.</p>
<p>The tortoise-shell paper-knife snapped in two.
Aymer fitted the ends together neatly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; he answered very deliberately. &#8220;I
told you he was my adopted son. I adopted him in
order to have something to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. Of course, of course.&#8221; A slow smile
spread over his big face. &#8220;Think of Aymer Aston
of all men in the world playing at being a family
man!&#8221;</p>
<p>He leant back in his chair and laughed out his
great hearty laugh whose boyish ring, coupled with the
laugher&#8217;s easy careless manners, had snared so many
fish into the financial net.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d like to make a family man of me again&mdash;do
their dear little best&mdash;but I&#8217;m not such a fool as they
think me. Men with brains and ambitions don&#8217;t want
a wife. You miss less than you think, old chap,&#8221;
he went on with the colossal tactlessness habitual to
him when his own interests were not at stake; &#8220;a wife
plays the devil with one&#8217;s business. I <i>know</i>.&#8221; He
nodded gloomily, the smile lost under a heavy frown.</p>
<p>Aymer put down very carefully the broken toy he
had been playing with. Peter&#8217;s elephantine tread was
so great that it had almost overstepped its victim. At
all events Aymer gave no outward sign that he felt it
except in his deepened colour and a faint straightening
of the lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;What on earth do you do with yourself?&#8221; went
on Peter thoughtfully; &#8220;the care of a kid like that
doesn&#8217;t absorb all your brains, I know.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What would you recommend me to do?&#8221; asked
Aymer quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;With your head for figures and your leisure you
should take to the Market. Have a machine and
tapes fitted up in reach, and, by Jove! in a quiet spot
like this, out of the way of other men&#8217;s panics and
nonsense, you could rule the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Market, I think you said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Same thing. Think of it, Aymer,&#8221; he went on
eagerly and genuinely interested in his proposition,
whether spontaneous or not. He began walking up
and down the room, working out his idea with that
grasp of detail that had made him the millionaire he
was.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could have the instruments and a private wire
fixed up along the wall there, and your sofa by them.
A clerk over there: it would be a sort of companion.
You&#8217;ve plenty of capital to start with, and wouldn&#8217;t
have to lose your head at the first wrong deal. Of
course you&#8217;d want someone the other end, a figurehead
and mouthpiece, and someone to show you the
lines, start you off; I&#8217;d be pleased to do it. We could
make a partnership concern of it, if you liked.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a quick sidelong glint in his eyes towards
Aymer as he came to a stand near the sofa.</p>
<p>&#8220;What particular results would you expect?&#8221; inquired
Aymer, knowing the only plan to keep the enthusiast
at bay was to humour him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, man, you might be the greatest power in the
world&mdash;you&mdash;the unseen, unknown, mysterious Brain&mdash;you
would have time&mdash;you would escape the crazy
influences that ruin half the men &#8216;on &#8217;Change&#8217;&mdash;and
you&#8217;ve got the head for it. Calculation, nerve, everything.
It would be just the thing for you. You&#8217;d
forget all about not being able to walk in a week. I
wonder why none of us have thought of it before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting used to it after twelve years,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
Aymer, with shut teeth; &#8220;the objection to your scheme
is that I do not happen to want money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Power, power, man,&#8221; cried the other impatiently.
&#8220;Money is just metal, its value lies in the grip it gives
you over other men, and if you don&#8217;t even care for
that, there&#8217;s the joy of chancing it. And you were a
born gambler, Aymer, you can&#8217;t deny that,&#8221; he laughed
heartily, but also again came the quick sidelong glint
of his eyes. &#8220;Think of it, old fellow,&#8221; he said carelessly,
dropping his enthusiastic tone, &#8220;it would be a
good deal better for you than doing nothing. It&#8217;s such
wicked waste.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time Aymer winced.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll think of it, and let you know if it&#8217;s likely to
be entertained. I have the boy, you know; that gives
me something to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poof! Let him bring himself up if you want to
make a successful man of him. The more he educates
himself, the better he&#8217;ll get on. If you do it, you&#8217;ll
make him soft. <i>I</i> know! Public School: University:
Examinations, and &pound;200 a year if he&#8217;s lucky.
That&#8217;s your education! All very well if you are born
with a golden spoon in your mouth and can afford to
be a fool. If you can&#8217;t, better learn to rough-and-tumble
it in the world. Education doesn&#8217;t make successful
men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were not exactly uneducated, Peter,&#8221; said
Aymer drily.</p>
<p>Peter grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, but I was a genius. I couldn&#8217;t help it. It
would have been the same had I been born in the gutter.
No, I believe in the rough-and-tumble school to
make hard-headed men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, for all you know, Christopher may be a
genius, or be born with a golden spoon in his mouth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other looked up sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevil has a boy of his own, hasn&#8217;t he?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a fool if you can help it, Peter. Other
people have golden spoons besides the gilded Aston
family.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;It&#8217;s no business of
mine, of course, but the boy looks sharp. Pity to spoil
him. Ha, Ha. I don&#8217;t spoil mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>He got up yawning and sauntered over to the fireplace
and so did not see Aymer&#8217;s rigid face go white
and then red.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a boy&mdash;I think it&#8217;s a boy&mdash;somewhere.
Daresay you&#8217;ve forgotten. You weren&#8217;t very sociable,
poor old chap, when it happened. About a year after
your accident. He&#8217;s about somewhere or other. Oh,
I back my own theories! I don&#8217;t suppose he&#8217;s a genius,
so the rough-and-tumble school for <i>him</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know the school?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can put my hand on him when I want to&mdash;that&#8217;s
not yet. The world can educate him till I&#8217;m ready to
step in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he&#8217;ll have you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter chuckled. &#8220;He won&#8217;t be a fool&mdash;even if he&#8217;s
not a genius. Well, you think of my proposition, I&#8217;ll
go halves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How you have disappointed me, Peter. I thought
you called from a disinterested desire to see me after
all these years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twelve years, isn&#8217;t it? Well, you look better than
you did then. I didn&#8217;t think you would come through&mdash;didn&#8217;t
think you meant to. I&#8217;m sorry to miss Cousin
Charles. He doesn&#8217;t approve of me, but he&#8217;s too
polite to say so, even in a letter. How does he wear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, on the whole. He works too hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other spread out his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Works. And to what end? I&#8217;m glad to have seen
you again. It&#8217;s like old times, if you weren&#8217;t on that
beastly sofa, poor old chap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you will call again when father is in,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
said Aymer steadily, with a mute wonder if a square
inch of him was left unbruised.</p>
<p>&#8220;To tell the truth, I&#8217;m rarely in London. I work
from Birmingham and New York, and calling is an
expensive amusement to a busy man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Produces nothing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, a good deal of pleasure. It&#8217;s worth it occasionally.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood over his cousin, looking down at him with
quite genuine concern and liking in his eyes. His size,
his aggressiveness, his blundering disregard of decency
towards trouble, everything about him was on such a
gigantic scale that one could not weigh him by any
accepted standard. Aymer knew it, and notwithstanding
Peter&#8217;s unique powers of hurting him to the soul,
he made no attempt to scale him, but met him on his
own ground and ignored the torture.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has it cost you exactly, this visit?&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter considered quite gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see. I was to have seen Tomlands. He&#8217;s
ceding his rights in the Lodal Valley Affair and his
figure goes up each day.&#8221; He considered again.
&#8220;Three thousand,&#8221; he answered with a wide grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am abashed at my value,&#8221; said Aymer gravely.
&#8220;I daren&#8217;t ask you to come again now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll have an extravagant fit again, some day.
Where&#8217;s the boy?&#8221; His hand was in his pocket and
Aymer heard the chink of coin.</p>
<p>&#8220;At work, or should be. Don&#8217;t tip him, please,
Peter. He has as much as he needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know? A boy needs as much as he
can get. Well, don&#8217;t forget my advice. Don&#8217;t educate
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was gone at last. Presumably to gather in the
Lodal Rights before their value further increased.</p>
<p>Charles Aston did not betray any particular sorrow
at missing the visitor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather odd his turning up again now after forgetting
our existence so long,&#8221; he remarked, frowning.
&#8220;Of course we&#8217;ve had correspondence&mdash;not very
agreeable either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can hardly wonder at his not coming to see me,
at all events. It&#8217;s nearly twelve years since we met,
and I wasn&#8217;t very polite to him that time,&#8221; said Aymer
wearily.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a reasonable excuse for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I did not consider reason much in those
days, sir. If he&#8217;d been a saint in disguise I should
have behaved like a brute just the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles Aston came and stood looking down with
a kind, quiet, satisfied smile. The attitude was the
same as Peter Masters&#8217; and Aymer, remembering it,
smiled too.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he really want, Aymer? He never came
for nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To induce me to go on the Stock-Exchange in
partnership with him, I think. Thought it would be
less boring than lying here all day with nothing to
do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles Aston opened his mouth to protest and shut
it resolutely, turned and walked down the room ruffling
his hair, so that when he went back to Aymer, his
iron-grey thatch was more picturesque than neat.</p>
<p>Aymer laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s lost his temper now?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>His father looked in a glass and, perceiving the devastation,
attempted to remedy it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully sorry,&#8221; he said with much contrition,
&#8220;but I can&#8217;t keep my temper over Peter. Has he improved?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit. He doesn&#8217;t hurt, father, he&#8217;s too big,&#8221;
he paused a moment, &#8220;he saw Christopher.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Aston gave Aymer a scrutinising glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was unavoidable, I suppose.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I did not try to stop it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the result?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no result except he appeared impressed
with his mental capacity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Aston ruffled his hair again in a perturbed manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t he see his likeness to his mother, Aymer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently not. It&#8217;s not so strong as it was. He
offered me advice on his upbringing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he?&#8221; with an indignant shake of the head.</p>
<p>&#8220;All in good faith,&#8221; said Aymer steadily, &#8220;he said
he didn&#8217;t approve of education; as a proof of his sincerity,
he cited the line he was taking with his own
boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said he could put his hand on him when he
liked.&#8221; Aymer&#8217;s voice was quite level and inexpressive,
but his father leant forward and put his hand on
his, saying hastily.</p>
<p>&#8220;He always says that. He believes it just a matter
of money. It was his one answer to all my remonstrances.
When he wanted him he could find him&mdash;not
before. Aymer, I wish I&#8217;d been at home. Why
did you see him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could hardly refuse; it would have been churlish&mdash;unpolitic.
I did not know why he came. He was
evidently struck with Christopher.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed a little unsteadily, but his father smothered
a sigh and watched him with curious solicitude.
The unwritten law that Christopher had learnt so well
had been very heavily infringed, and Charles Aston
had no liking for the man who had infringed it, though
he was his first cousin.</p>
<p>He was weighing in his mind what his son must
have suffered in that interview, and trying to see if it
could have been foreseen and prevented.</p>
<p>Peter and Aymer, who was only five years his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
junior, had been great friends in the far-off days before
the tragedy, but the former was too nearly,
though half unconsciously, connected with that to be
a possible intimate for Aymer now. The possibility
of his turning up in this casual manner, ignoring with
ruthless amiability all that had passed, had really never
occurred to either father or son, and they were both
unprepared for a narrowly escaped crisis. But Aymer
was evidently not going to own frankly how great
had been the strain and how badly he had suffered
under it. He set his pride to heal his bruised feelings,
however, applauding himself secretly for not betraying
to his cousin the torture to which he had unintentionally
put him. But he could not, having done this,
altogether put it from him, and the subject of Peter
Masters cropped up next morning when Christopher
was sitting on the edge of C&aelig;sar&#8217;s bed.</p>
<p>Aymer asked him abruptly what he thought of the
visitor of the previous day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like him at all. I think he&#8217;s beastly,&#8221; was
Master Christopher&#8217;s emphatic verdict.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is my second cousin, his mother was an Aston,
and he is one of the richest men in England, if not
quite the richest. He is thought rich even in
America.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And horrid, too, just the same: only perhaps I
oughtn&#8217;t to say so as he is your cousin,&#8221; added the
boy with sudden confusion.</p>
<p>Aymer regarded him with an introspective air.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a strange man, though many people don&#8217;t
like him. We were great friends once.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher opened his eyes very wide.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You</i>&mdash;and Mr. Masters?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;when I was a young man like others. We
quarrelled&mdash;or rather I quarrelled&mdash;he came to see me
when I was first&mdash;ill,&#8221; he jerked the word out awkwardly,
but never took his eyes from Christopher&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
face. &#8220;I was perfectly brutal to him. That&#8217;s twelve
years ago. Most men would never have spoken to me
again, but he doesn&#8217;t bear malice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t mind what anyone said to him,&#8221; persisted
Christopher; &#8220;fancy your being friends!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You like me best then?&#8221;</p>
<p>Master Christopher caught up a pillow and hurled
it at him, and then made a violent effort to smother
him under it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re almost as nasty&mdash;when you say
things like that, C&aelig;sar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then retreat from my company and tell Vespasian
his baby is waiting to be dressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vespasian found his master in one of his rare inconsequent
moods, talking nonsense with provoking
persistence and exercising his wits in teasing everyone
who came in his way.</p>
<p>Vespasian smiled indulgently and spent his leisure
that day in assisting Christopher to construct a man-of-war
out of empty biscuit boxes and cotton reels, for
he was dimly possessed of the idea that the boy was
in some way connected with his master&#8217;s unusually
good spirits.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>
<p>It was not until Christopher had passed his fourteenth
birthday that he came face to face once more with the
distant past. He had crossed Westminster Bridge to
watch the trams on the other side, and from there,
being in an adventurous mood, he had wandered out
into vague regions lying beyond, regions of vast warehouses,
of narrow, dirty streets and squalid houses, of
sudden palaces of commerce towering over the low
tide of mean roofs. Suddenly turning a corner, he had
come on a block of &#8220;model dwellings,&#8221; and an inrush
of memories brought him to a standstill before the
giant ugly pile.</p>
<p>There, on the topmost floor of the east corner of
Block D, had lived Martha Sartin, and Marley Sartin,
packer at one of the big warehouses near, also
Jessie Sartin and numerous other Sartins, including
Sam, who was about Christopher&#8217;s age; there in the
dull asphalt court Sam and Christopher had played,
and up that steep stairway had climbed in obedience
to husky shouts from over the iron railings of the top
landing.</p>
<p>It was all so vivid, so unaltered, so sharply set in
Christopher&#8217;s mind that he had to look down at his
own immaculate blue suit and unpatched boots to reassure
himself he was not waiting for Martha&#8217;s shrill
order to &#8220;come up out of the dirt.&#8221; But assured once
more of his own present personality he could not resist
exploring further, and went right up to the foot
of the iron staircase and looked up. It was all just
as sordid and dirty and unlovely as ever, though he
had not known before the measure of its undesirableness.
Leaning over the railing of the top landing was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
an untidy-looking woman in a brown skirt and half-fastened
blouse. She looked over into the yard and
shouted in a voice that made Christopher jump.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim, come up out of the dirt, you little varmint!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Christopher, erstwhile Jim, leant against the
wall and felt his head was whirling round. Then he
inspected himself again, but at that moment a shock-headed
dirty mite of four years brushed past him and
began to clamber up the stairs, pushing his way
through the horde of small babies on each landing and
squealing shrilly, &#8220;I&#8217;m coming, Mammie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher went too. He could not possibly have
resisted the impulse, for assuredly it was Martha&#8217;s
voice that called&mdash;called him back willy nilly to the
past that after all was not so far past except in a boy&#8217;s
measure of time.</p>
<p>A dark-eyed, decent-looking woman passed him on
the stair and looked at him curiously; further on a
man, smoking a pipe, took the trouble to follow him
to the next floor in a loafing fashion. The small Jim,
out of breath and panting with the exertion of the
climb, was being roughly dusted by an undoubted
Martha when Christopher reached the topmost landing.
She was stouter than of yore, and her hair was
no longer done up in iron curlers as of old, also a baby,
younger than Jim, was crawling out of the room on
the right. But it was Martha Sartin, and Christopher
advanced a friendly hand.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sartin gazed at the apparition with blank
amazement. She could connect the tall, pleasant-faced
boy in his spotless suit and straw hat with nothing
in her memory. He did not look as if he could
belong to the theatre at which she was a dresser, but
it seemed the only solution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you come from Miss Vassour?&#8221; she asked
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know me, Mrs. Sartin?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Know ye? No. How should I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Jim Hibbault.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Garn!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am really.&#8221; Poor Christopher began to
feel embarrassed and a little disappointed.</p>
<p>He <i>was</i> Jim Hibbault at that moment and he felt
queerly lonely and stranded.</p>
<p>Martha pulled down her sleeves and went to the
inner door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jessie, come out &#8217;ere,&#8221; she screamed.</p>
<p>Christopher felt his heart go thump. He had almost
forgotten Jessie, yet Jessie had been more to
him than Martha in other days. It was Jessie who had
taken him for walks, carried him up the steep stairs
on her back, shared sweets with him, cuffed her
brother Sam when they fought, and had finally taken
little Jim Hibbault back to his mother when the great
clock in the distance struck six,&mdash;Jessie, who at eleven
had been a complete little mother and was at sixteen
a tall, lanky, untidy girl who had inherited the curling
pins of her mother and whose good-natured, not ill-looking
face was not improved thereby.</p>
<p>She came to the doorway and stood looking over her
mother&#8217;s arm at Christopher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever seed &#8217;im afore?&#8221; demanded Mrs. Sartin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well I never, if it ain&#8217;t Jimmy!&#8221; cried Jessie,
beaming, and Christopher could have embraced her if
it were in accordance with the custom of his years, and
he felt less inclined to bolt down the stairs out of
reach of his adventure.</p>
<p>Neither of the two women expressed any pleasure
at his appearance. Mrs. Sartin accepted her daughter&#8217;s
recognition of their visitor as sufficient evidence
it was not a hoax, and asked Christopher in.</p>
<p>The room, though the window was open, smelt just
as stuffy as of old, and a familiar litter of toys and
odds and ends strewed the floor. Christopher missed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
the big tea-tray and Britannia metal teapot, but the
sofa with broken springs was still there, covered as it
had ever been with the greater part of the family wardrobe.</p>
<p>Christopher sat in the armchair, and Mrs. Sartin,
having plumped the baby into its chair, sat down by
the door. The small Jimmy pulled at her apron.
Jessie leant against the wall and giggled. No one said
anything. Christopher began to wish he had not come.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never could remember the name of this place,&#8221;
he began at last, desperately. &#8220;I just came on it by
accident to-day, and remembered everything all at
once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shilla Buildings, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s called,&#8221; said Mrs.
Sartin nodding her head. &#8220;Block 7, C. Door.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silence again. A strict sense of etiquette prevented
either of the feminine side of the company from uttering
the question burning on their tongues.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did see Sam once, a long time ago,&#8221; Christopher
struggled on, &#8220;but I could not catch him.&#8221; He
got red and embarrassed again.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ows your Ma?&#8221; asked Mrs. Sartin at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s dead,&#8221; explained Christopher very gravely,
&#8220;five years ago now&mdash;more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lor&#8217;. To think of it. I never thought she was
one to live long. And she went back to her friends
after all, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not a question: it was only a statement to be
confirmed or contradicted or ignored as the hearer
liked.</p>
<p>&#8220;She died in the Union at Whitmansworth,&#8221; said
Christopher bluntly. &#8220;I lived there afterwards and
then someone adopted me. Mr. Aymer Aston, son of
Mr. Aston. Perhaps you know the name.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sartin appeared to consult an imaginary visiting
list.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t say as I do. Do you, Jessie?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>Jessie shook her head. She had ceased to look at
their visitor; instead, she looked at his boots, and her
cheeks grew red.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I would like to see if you were still
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good of you, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221; It was not meant
ironically, it was solely addressed to the blue suit and
brown boots, but it nearly reduced the wearer of these
awe-inspiring clothes to tears.</p>
<p>For the moment, in the clutch of the past, with associations
laying gripping hands on him and with his
curious faculty of responding to the outward call,
Aston House and the Astons became suddenly a faint
blurred impression to Christopher, less real and tangible
than these worn, sordid surroundings. Had anyone
just then demanded his name he would undoubtedly
have responded &#8220;Hibbault.&#8221; He felt confused
and wretched, alive to the fact that little Jim
Hibbault had neither people nor home nor relations in
the world, if these once kindly women had no welcome
for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard you call Jim,&#8221; he hazarded at last, in an
extremity of disconcerted shyness.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sartin eyed the four-year-old nestling in her
apron and pulled him from cover.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that be Jim. We called &#8217;im Jim arter you.
He was born arter you an&#8217; your ma went away.&#8221;</p>
<p>He longed to ask after Marley of unhappy memory,
but the possibilities were too apparent for him to venture,
so silence again fell over them.</p>
<p>At this precise juncture of affairs a shrill whistle
was heard ascending the stairway, growing momentarily
louder and louder till it became earsplitting in
intensity as it arrived on landing No. 6. The author
of it pulled open the door and the whistle tailed off
into a faint &#8220;phew&#8221; at sight of the embarrassed group.
The new-comer was a thin-faced lad with light sandy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
hair cropped close to his square head. He had light,
undetermined eyes that were keen and lively. Christopher
had beaten him in the matter of size, but there
were latent possibilities in his ill-developed form.</p>
<p>Christopher sprang up and rushed forward, then
suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ullo, mother, didn&#8217;t know as &#8217;ow you &#8217;ad swell
company this arternoon. I&#8217;d &#8217;ave put on my best suit
and topper,&#8221; he grinned affably as he deposited on the
floor a big basket he carried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I say, Sam&mdash;don&#8217;t you know me either?&#8221;
began poor Christopher.</p>
<p>He wheeled round, stared hard, and a broad smile
of recognition spread over his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, if it ain&#8217;t Jim,&#8221; he cried and seized his hand
with a fervour that set Christopher aglowing and
strangely enough set him free from the clinging
shadow of his lost identity. <i>This</i> was tangible flesh
and blood and of the real authentic present.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m blowed,&#8221; ejaculated Sam, stepping back
to look at his erstwhile companion, &#8220;to think of you
turning up again such a toff. No need to ask what
sort of luck came <i>your</i> way. My. Ain&#8217;t &#8217;e a swell,
just.&#8221;</p>
<p>But unlike the women, he was unabashed by externals.
He demanded &#8220;tea&#8221; of his mother that very
moment, &#8220;cos &#8217;e &#8217;adn&#8217;t no time for dinner and &#8217;is
bloke &#8217;ad sent &#8217;im round to get a bit o&#8217; somethink
now,&#8221; at a slack hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Greengrocer business, Clare Street,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;Seven shillings a week. Not a bad old cove. What
d&#8217;yer say about yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>He had the whole history out of Christopher in five
minutes.</p>
<p>The women listened and flung in &#8220;Well, I never&#8217;s,&#8221;
and &#8220;Who&#8217;d &#8217;ave thought it&#8217;s&#8221; from time to time and
thawed into ordinary human beings under Sam&#8217;s convivial
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
example. In the end Sam offered sincere if
oddly-expressed congratulations, and disappeared into
the back kitchen to wash his hands. Jessie, too, vanished
mysteriously, eventually returning minus the
curling pins and plus a row of impossible curls and a
bright blue blouse bedecked with cheap lace. Mrs.
Sartin meanwhile tidied up by kicking the scattered
toys under the sofa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Them sisters what looks arter the poor is always
givin&#8217; broken rubbish to the children,&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;Not but what they mean it kindly, but it makes
a heap of muck to clear up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher nodded his head comprehendingly, by
no means so hurt at her ingratitude as a real Christopher
Aston might have been.</p>
<p>The good woman bustled about, and eventually the
family drew up round the tea table. The cloth might
have been cleaner, the cups and saucers have borne a
longer acquaintance with water, and there was a spoon
short, though no one was so ill-mannered as to allude
to it. Jessie unobtrusively shared hers with her
mother under cover of the big tea-pot. There was
bread and a yellow compound politely alluded to as
butter, and a big pot of jam. The younger Sartins
gorged silently on this, all unreproved by a preoccupied
mother. Mrs. Sartin, indeed, became quite voluble
and told Christopher how she was now first dresser at
the Kings Theatre and how Jessie was just taken on
in the wardrobe room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is uncertain <i>hours</i>,&#8221; Mrs. Sartin explained,
&#8220;but it&#8217;s nice to be together in the same &#8217;ouse, and
one couldn&#8217;t want a kinder gentleman than Mr. X. to
do with. I&#8217;ve been there ten years and never &#8217;ad a
cross word with &#8217;im. And &#8217;e was that good when Marley
was took, and never turned me off as some of &#8217;em
do.&#8221; She stopped suddenly under the stress of Sam&#8217;s
lowering countenance. Jessie hastily passed her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
bread, &#8220;which I thanks you for, but will say what I
was a-goin&#8217; to, for all Sam&#8217;s kicks under the table,&#8221;
continued the hostess, defiantly regarding her confused
offspring.</p>
<p>The confusion spread to Christopher, who looked at
his plate and got red. Sam pushed back his chair;
there was a very ugly scowl on his face. His undaunted
mother addressed herself to their guest.</p>
<p>&#8220;No woman ever &#8217;ad a better &#8217;usband than Marley,
though I ses it, but Sam here &#8217;s that &#8217;ard &#8217;e won&#8217;t let
me speak of my own man if &#8217;e can &#8217;elp &#8217;it. &#8217;Is own
father, too. Ah, if &#8217;e &#8217;ad &#8217;ad a bad father, Sam would
&#8217;ave know what to be thankful for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thankful &#8217;e&#8217;s gone,&#8221; burst out Sam, with sudden
anger. &#8220;I asks you, &#8217;ow&#8217;s a cove to get on when
he&#8217;s &#8217;itched up to a father wot&#8217;s done time? Why, old
Greenum gave me a shillin&#8217; a week less than &#8217;e ought,
cos why, &#8217;e knew I couldn&#8217;t &#8217;old out with a father like
that,&#8221; and he eyed his mother wrathfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;A better &#8217;usband no woman &#8217;ad,&#8221; sobbed Mrs.
Sartin. &#8220;When &#8217;e came out &#8217;e didn&#8217;t seem to get no
chance and so....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he in London?&#8221; asked Christopher, nervously
gulping down some tea.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;sloped,&#8221; said Sam, shortly, &#8220;cribbed some
other chap&#8217;s papers I guess&mdash;went abroad&mdash;we don&#8217;t
know&mdash;don&#8217;t want to, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fierce hostility and resentment in the boy&#8217;s
voice made it clear to Christopher this was evidently
a subject better dropped. He seized the chance of
directing Jessie&#8217;s attention to Master Jim Sartin, who
was brandishing the bread-knife, and plunged hastily
into a description of the doings of Charlotte and Max.
Mrs. Sartin accepted the diversion, but kept an anxious
eye on Sam, who ate hard and seemed to recover
some of his ordinary composure with each mouthful,
much to Christopher&#8217;s amazement. By the time tea was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
finished he was himself again. There was no lingering
then. He went back to work. Christopher said
he must go too, and bade the family good-bye. The
farewell was as cordial as the welcome had been cold
and he clattered downstairs after Sam with many
promises to come again.</p>
<p>The two boys talked freely of the passing world as
they went through the streets, in the purely impersonal
way of their age, and it was with great diffidence
and much hesitation Christopher managed to hint he&#8217;d
like to buy something for the kiddies.</p>
<p>Sam grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sweets,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;They eat &#8217;em up and
leave no mess about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher turned out his pockets. There was an
unbroken ten shillings, three shillings and some
coppers.</p>
<p>They walked on a while gravely and came to a stand
before a confectioner&#8217;s window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cake,&#8221; suggested Sam, with one eye on his companion
and one on the show of food within.</p>
<p>&#8220;A sugar one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They cost a lot,&#8221; said Sam shaking his head, but
he followed Christopher inside. Christopher boldly
demanded the price of a small wedding cake elaborately
iced. It was five shillings.</p>
<p>He put down the money with a lofty air and desired
them to send it without loss of time to Mrs. Sartin&#8217;s
address.</p>
<p>The woman stared a little at the oddly assorted couple,
but the money rang true and the order was booked.</p>
<p>As they hurried towards Clare Street, Christopher
diffidently asked if there was anything Mrs. Sartin
would like, and Sam&#8217;s sharp wits seized the occasion
to please his mother and Christopher and serve himself
at the same time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on to my place and send her some lettuce,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
he suggested. &#8220;Mother&#8217;s main fond of lettuce. We&#8217;ve
got some good &#8217;uns in this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was strictly true; it was also true that Master Sam
had outstayed his meal-time and a new customer might
help to avert the probable storm awaiting him, as indeed
it did.</p>
<p>Mr. Gruner, greengrocer, was standing at the door
of his shop looking both ways down the street at once,
owing to a remarkable squint, and his reception of
Sam was unfriendly, but quickly checked at the sight
of his companion, whose extraordinary terms of intimacy
with his errand boy rendered the good man
nearly speechless. The young gent, however, ordered
lettuces and green peas with a free hand and earned
Sam&#8217;s pardon, as anticipated by that far-sighted youth.</p>
<p>The two boys said good-bye and Sam made no hint
as to the possibilities of a future meeting, neither did
Christopher, embarrassed by the presence of the greengrocer.
He also would be late and hurried off, hoping
he might still be in time to give Aymer tea and relate
his adventures. He had no misgivings at all as to
C&aelig;sar&#8217;s approval of his doings.</p>
<p>As he came out into a main thoroughfare again he
passed a big cheap drapery establishment and something
in the gaudy, crude colouring there displayed
brought him to a standstill. Jessie was still unprovided
with a present. The two had exchanged very
few words, but she by no means loomed in the background
of the picture. He stood staring at the window
and fingering the remaining coins in his pocket.
One section of the shop front was hung with gaily-coloured
feather boas. He was dimly conscious he had
seen Mrs. Wyatt wear something of the sort in soft
grey. There was a blue one that was the colour of
Jessie&#8217;s blouse, or so Christopher thought, hanging
high up. He did not admire it at all, but it suggested
Jessie to him and after a moment&#8217;s consideration he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
boldly pushed through the swinging doors and
marched up the shop.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want one of those feather things in the window,&#8221;
he announced to the shop-walker&#8217;s assiduous attentions.</p>
<p>He was delivered over to the care of an amused
young woman, who proceeded to show him feather
boas of all descriptions and qualities. Christopher was
adamant.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want a blue thing that&#8217;s hanging up in the window,
last but one on the top row,&#8221; he insisted, disdaining
to look at the fluffy abominations spread around
him. He was sure they were not like the thing Constantia
wore now, but it was too late to retreat.</p>
<p>The young woman showed him one she declared was
identical.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want the one in the window,&#8221; he persisted doggedly.</p>
<p>In the end he got it, paid for it, saw it packed up
and addressed, and quenching sundry misgivings in
his heart, marched out of the shop and treated himself
to a bus homeward.</p>
<p>It is perhaps not out of place to mention here that
Jessie had no misgivings as to the real beauty of the
present. She had sighed long for such a possession,
and having never seen Mrs. Wyatt&#8217;s delicate costly
wrap, was perfectly content with her own and applauded
Christopher&#8217;s taste loudly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>
<p>Christopher continued to visit the Sartins and to
find considerable pleasure in Sam&#8217;s companionship,
who on his few holidays was only too glad to explore
the grey river and its innumerable wharfs with Christopher.
Sam was already a fair waterman; he at least
spent all his scant leisure and scantier pennies in learning
that arduous profession.</p>
<p>Once Mr. Aston visited Block D. with Christopher,
and lingered behind gossiping to Mrs. Sartin while
the boy went to meet Sam, expected home to tea. Sam
got nothing out of his mother anent that conversation
except the information that Mr. Aston was &#8220;a
real Christian gentleman, who knew what trouble was,
and don&#8217;t you make any mistake, but as &#8217;ow Mr. Christopher
was a lucky young gentleman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Aston also found time to visit Sam&#8217;s master,
though on this occasion he was not accompanied by
Christopher, who, indeed, chanced to be on the river
with Sam Sartin that afternoon.</p>
<p>It must not be imagined that Christopher had no
other friends than the humble Sartins. Besides the
Wyatt household, half a dozen families with boys of
his age welcomed him gladly enough, but though he
was on good terms with these and though not one of
the boys could afford to despise him as an antagonist
in any sport, yet none of them contrived to have more
than a very superficial idea of Christopher Aston.
They took to him at once, but he remained just the
good-natured, jolly acquaintance of the first day, never
more, if never less. Christopher, indeed, though he
confessed it to no one, not even to Aymer, felt a little
cut off from this pleasant clan, who held the same traditions,
the same experiences, and who went through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
the same training at their various schools, who led indeed
a life that differed essentially from Christopher.</p>
<p>He was never conscious of any lack of company.
The Astons, old and young, were companions who
answered to every need of his energetic mind. He
made giant strides in his studies in these days and
passed beyond the average into the class of those of
real ability. All his well-earned holidays were spent
at Marden, where there was always Patricia as a most
admirable playfellow.</p>
<p>It was when Christopher was a little over fifteen and
Patricia about the same age that the first definite result
of their companionship came about.</p>
<p>On the other side of the lake at Marden Court the
high road, sunk between a low wall on one side and
the upsloping land on the other, ran directly eastward
and westward, joining eventually a second Great Road
of historic importance to Christopher Aston. The
rough ground beyond the road was covered with low
scrub, and dwarf twisted hawthorns, with a plentiful
show of molehills. Here and there were groups of
Scotch firs, and the crest of the hill was wooded with
oaks and beeches and a fringe of larches, with here and
there a silvery black poplar.</p>
<p>Christopher and Patricia were fond of this rough
land that lay beyond the actual park. In early days it
had made a glorious stage for &#8220;desert islanders,&#8221; with
the isle-studded lake to bound it, whose further shore
for the nonce melted into vague mistiness. Later on,
when desert islands were out of fashion, it was still
good ground to explore, and through the woods away
over the hill one came to a delectable wide-spread
country, where uncultivated down mingled with cornfields
and stretches of clover, a country bounded by
long, spacious curving lines of hill and dale, tree-capped
ridges and bare contours, with here and there
the gash of a chalk pit gleaming white.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>Just at a point where a stretch of down-land ran into
a little copse, was a small barrow. A round green
mound, memento of a forgotten history that was real
and visible enough in its own day, as real as the two
children of &#8220;the Now,&#8221; with whom the spot was a
favourite camping ground.</p>
<p>Patricia, who knew all about barrows from Nevil,
used to invent wonderful stories of this one, to which
Christopher lent a critical attention, adding here and
there a practical touch.</p>
<p>It was he who first suggested exploring the mound,
and one day they dragged heavy spades thither and
worked hard for an hour or two without great result,
when suddenly Patricia began shovelling back her pile
of brown earth with feverish haste.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it. It is horrid,&#8221; she panted in
return to Christopher&#8217;s protests. The idea of desecration
was so strong on her that when her companion
still indignantly protested, the black passion leapt up
to life and she flung round at him.</p>
<p>It was then that Christopher made his discovery.
He saw the mad flare in her face and flung his strong
arms round her from behind, and held her against him
with her hands in his gripped fast to her breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steady on, Patricia,&#8221; he said sharply, &#8220;don&#8217;t get
frightened. You aren&#8217;t going to get wild this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no alarm or anger in his voice and a
queer, new note of firmness and force. She struggled
ineffectually a moment and then came the dangerous
quietness that waited a chance.</p>
<p>He could feel her muscles strained and rigid still.</p>
<p>&#8220;Patricia,&#8221; he said quite loudly, &#8220;drop it. I won&#8217;t
have it, do you hear? You <i>can</i> stop if you like now,
and you&#8217;ve got to.&#8221;</p>
<p>She bent back her head and looked at him, her child
face old and worn and disfigured with her still burning
fury. She looked right in his eyes: his met hers steady
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
and hard as flints, and through the blind passion of her
look he saw her soul leap up, appealing, piteous, and
by heaven-taught instinct, he answered that.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Patricia, you are safe enough. I&#8217;m
not going to let you make a fool of yourself, my dear;
don&#8217;t be afraid. Stop thinking. Look at the dark
shadows over there&mdash;on the cornfield. They&#8217;ll cut that
next week.&#8221;</p>
<p>Little by little he loosed his grasp on her as he felt
the tension slacken, and presently she stood free, still
dazed and bewildered. Christopher picked up a spade
and whistled.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the same, you are right, Patricia,&#8221; he said
thoughtfully, &#8220;it does seem a shame to disturb the old
Johnny, and creepy too. I&#8217;ll fill up.&#8221;</p>
<p>He continued to work hard, watching her out of the
corner of his eye, but talking cheerfully. Presently
she took up her spade and made a poor pretence of
helping him, but she said nothing till they had done
and he suggested a return.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mind resting a bit, first?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her subdued voice called for a scrutinising glance.
Then he dropped his spade and flung himself on the
grass by her side. A little wind swept up the downland
to them, making the brown benets nod in a friendly
fashion. The purple scabious, too, nodded cheerfully.
Patricia picked one and began stroking it with her fingers.
Christopher lay on his back and whistled again
softly, watching a lark, as he had watched one five
years ago, when a small boy, by the side of the Great
Road.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christopher, how did you do it?&#8221; demanded Patricia
abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t. You stopped yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never have before.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then you ought to have. You see you can, if you
only will think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>can&#8217;t</i> think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you did,&#8221; he insisted, with some reason.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you made me. I&#8217;d have been much angrier
with anyone else&mdash;it was like&mdash;like&mdash;holding
on to a rock, when the water was sucking one away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bosh,&#8221; said Christopher, sitting upright suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Patricia, it was only that I made you
take time to think: no one, even you (he put in rudely
enough), could be silly enough to make such a little
idiot of yourself if you <i>thought</i> a moment. Everyone
seems to take it for granted you&#8217;ll go on being&mdash;stupid&mdash;or
else they are afraid to stop you, and I&mdash;well
I won&#8217;t have it, Patricia, that&#8217;s all. You must
jolly well learn to stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>His boyish words were rougher than his voice, just
as his real feeling in the matter was deeper than his
expression of it, and secretly he was a little proud of
his achievement and felt a subtle proprietorship over
his companion that was not displeasing.</p>
<p>Patricia slipped her arm in his and leant her golden
head against him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christopher, I want to tell you all I can remember
about it. I don&#8217;t know what anyone else has told
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, fire away,&#8221; returned Christopher resignedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing I can remember at all about my
father is seeing him get into rages like that with my
mother. I can remember him quite well, at all sorts of
times; he was very big and fair, and splendid, but always
everything I remember ends in that. And I can
remember getting in a rage when I was quite little and
seeing my mother turn white, and she jumped up and
ran out of the room crying out to Renata. My father
was killed hunting when I was six years old and mother
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
died when I was nine years old. Renata was married
then, you know, so I came to live with her and Nevil.
But always I remembered when I was naughty like
that, my mother used to look frightened and go away
and our old nurse used to come and scold me and
watch me till I could have killed her. Renata, darling
Renata, used to talk to me after and make me promise
to try and be good, but she, too, was really afraid when
I was bad. I suppose they had both had so bad a time
with father.&#8221; She stopped, gazing out at a misty half-understood
tragedy, whose very dimness woke a faint
echo of terror in her heart, for she was as surely the
daughter of the woman who had suffered as of the man
who had caused the suffering.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all,&#8221; said Patricia, with a sudden movement,
&#8220;everyone always takes it as part of me. Nevil
says I&#8217;ll outgrow it. I don&#8217;t&mdash;and Renata cries.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I scold you. Anyhow, it isn&#8217;t part of you in
my eyes, but just a beastly sort of thing which you let
get hold of you, and then it isn&#8217;t you at all. It&#8217;s all
rot inheriting things, though of course, if you <i>think</i>
so&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; this young philosopher on the much-debated
subject shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t think so, I don&#8217;t want to think so,&#8221;
cried poor Patricia; &#8220;it&#8217;s just because you don&#8217;t think
it that you made me feel I can stop it. Oh, Christopher,
go on believing I can help it, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I do. Of course I do. It&#8217;s a beastly shame
anyone ever suggested anything else to you. Come
along home, Patricia, it will be tea-time.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was the establishing of a covenant between the
two. Whether it was from the suggestion or the dominant
will of the boy himself, or both causes combined,
Patricia began to gather strength against her terrible
inheritance and, at all events in Christopher&#8217;s presence,
actually did gain some show of control over her fits of
passion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>The first of these times, about six months after the
covenant on the barrow, Nevil was present. Renata
and one of the children had been there also, but Renata
had seen the queer pallor creep up in her sister&#8217;s
face before even Christopher had guessed and had
straightway hurried off with Master Max, a proceeding
which usually precipitated events.</p>
<p>Then Christopher flung down his work and caught
her clenched hand in his.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop it, Patricia,&#8221; he said imperiously.</p>
<p>Nevil held his breath. It was a tradition in the
Connell family that interference invariably led to a
catastrophe. In his indolent way he had taken this
belief on trust, the &#8220;laissez faire&#8221; policy being well
in accordance with his easy nature.</p>
<p>However, tradition was clearly wrong, for after one
ineffectual struggle, Patricia stood still and presently
said something to Christopher that Nevil did not
catch, but he saw the boy free her and Patricia remained
silently looking out of the window. Christopher
turned to pick up his book, and for the first time
remembered Nevil was present and grew rather red.
Nevil had watched them both with a speculative eye,
for the moment an historian of the future rather than
of the past. He said nothing, however, but having
discoursed a while on the possibility of skating next
day, sauntered away.</p>
<p>He came to anchor eventually in Aymer&#8217;s room, and
sat smoking by the fire, his long legs crossed and the
contemplative mood in the ascendency. His brother
knew from experience that Nevil had something to
say, and would say it in his own inimitable way if
left alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christopher&#8217;s a remarkable youth,&#8221; he said presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you just discovered it?&#8221; said Aymer drily.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is no respecter of persons,&#8221; pursued Nevil
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
quietly; &#8220;by the way, has it ever struck you, Aymer,
that he&#8217;ll marry some day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s time before us, yet. I hope. He isn&#8217;t
quite sixteen, Nevil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but there it is,&#8221; he waved his hand vaguely.
&#8220;I think of it for myself when I look at Max sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer wanted to laugh out loud, which would have
reduced his brother&#8217;s communicative mood to mere
frivolity, and he wished to get at what lay behind, so
he remained grave.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Patricia, too,&#8221; went on Nevil in the same
vague way. &#8220;She, too, will do it some day. It&#8217;s lamentable,
but unavoidable. And talking of Patricia
brings me back to Christopher&#8217;s remarkableness.&#8221;</p>
<p>He related the little scene he had just witnessed in
his slow, clear way, made no comment thereon, but
poked the fire meditatively, when he had finished.</p>
<p>Aymer, too, was silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are her sole guardian, are you not?&#8221; he
asked presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Renata. I wonder, Aymer, if anyone could
have controlled that unhappy Connell?&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer ignored the irrelevant remark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Renata does not count. Nevil, would you have
any objections&mdash;as her guardian?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil strolled across to his brother and sat on the
edge of his couch. He took up a sandy kitten, descendant
of one of Christopher&#8217;s early pets, and began
playing with it, attempting to wrap it up in his
handkerchief.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you would mind, we will guard against the remote
contingency at which you hint, by keeping Christopher
away when he is a bit older,&#8221; said Aymer
steadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear C&aelig;sar, it&#8217;s not I who might object&mdash;it&#8217;s
you. You know what Patricia is, poor child. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
thought it might not fit in with your plans. She hasn&#8217;t
a penny of her own, though, of course, Renata and I
will see to that.&#8221; He knotted the handkerchief at the
four corners and swung it to and fro to the astonishment
of the imprisoned kitten.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christopher has nothing either,&#8221; said Aymer almost
sharply, &#8220;and I shall see to that, with your permission,
Nevil. That unfortunate kitten!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil released it. It scampered over the floor, hid
under a chair and then rushed back at him and scrambled
up his leg.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, if things turn out as I hope, I shall have
to provide for him,&#8221; went on Aymer steadily, &#8220;indeed
I wish to do so anyway. It will mean less for Max,
but&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a beastly ugly kitten,&#8221; remarked Nevil suddenly
with great emphasis, placing the animal very
gently on the floor again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t swear, Nevil,&#8221; retorted Aymer with a little
ghost of a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; answered his brother meekly, &#8220;but
it is. Aymer, don&#8217;t be an ass, old fellow&mdash;Max won&#8217;t
want anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>He lounged out presently before Aymer could
make up his mind to vex him further with the question
of Max&#8217;s inheritance.</p>
<p>The property set aside for the use of the son and
heir of the Astons provided a very handsome income,
the original capital of which could not be touched.
In early days Aymer had found the income barely sufficient
for his wants. He spent it freely now&mdash;the
Astons were no misers, but his father and he managed
to nearly double the original capital and this was Aymer&#8217;s
to do with as he would. Apparently he meant
it for Christopher. It was one of Nevil&#8217;s little weaknesses
that he could not endure any reminder of the
fact that to him and his small son would the line descend,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
and that his brother&#8217;s was but a life interest,
and his position as his father&#8217;s heir a merely formal
matter of no actual value. Poor Nevil, who was the
least self-seeking of men, could not endure any reminder
of his elder brother&#8217;s real condition of life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>
<p>There was a certain princely building in Birmingham
where all the business connected with the name
of Peter Masters was transacted. On each floor were
long rooms full of clerks bending over rows of desks,
carrying on with automatic regularity the affairs of
each separate concern. Thus on the ground floor the
Lack Vale Coal Company worked out its grimy history,
on the second floor the Brunt Rubber Company
had command, on the fifth the great Steel Axle Company,
the richest and most important of all, lodged
royally. But on the very topmost floor of all were
the offices devoted to the personal affairs of Peter
Masters, and through them, shut in by a watchful
guard of head clerks, was the innermost sanctum,
the nest of the great spider whose intricate web
stretched over so great a circumference, the central
point from which radiated the vast circle of concerns,
and to which they ultimately returned materialised
into precious metal&mdash;the private office, in short, of
Peter Masters.</p>
<p>The heads of each separate floor were picked men&mdash;great
men away from the golden glamour of the
master mind&mdash;each involved in the success or failure
of his own concern, all partners in their respective
firms, but partners who accepted the share allotted to
them without question, who served faithfully or disappeared
from the ken of their fellow-workers, who
were nominally accountable to their respective &#8220;company,&#8221;
but actually dependent on the word and will
of the great man up above them. None but these men
and his own special clerks ever approached him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
Some junior clerk or obscure worker might pass him
occasionally in a passage, or await the service of the
lift at his pleasure; they might receive a sharp glance,
a demand for name and department, but they knew
no more of this controller of their humble destinies.</p>
<p>It was a marvellous organisation, a perfected system,
a machine whose parts were composed of living
men.</p>
<p>The owner of the machine cared much for the
whole and nothing for the parts. When some screw
or nut failed to answer its purpose, it was cast aside
and another substituted. There was no question, no
appeal. Nuts and screws are cheap. The various
parts were well cared for, well oiled, just so long as
they fulfilled their purpose; if they failed in that&mdash;well,
the running of the machine was not endangered
for sentiment.</p>
<p>Apart from this business, however, Peter Masters
was a man of sentiment, though the workers in Masters&#8217;s
Building would have scorned the idea. He had
expended this sentiment on two people, one, his wife,
who had died in Whitmansworth Union, the other
Aymer Aston, his cousin, who on the moment of his
declared union with Elizabeth Hibbault, had fallen
victim to so grim a tragedy. His &#8220;sentiment&#8221; had
never spread beyond these two people, certainly never
to the person of his unseen child, whom, however,
he was prepared to &#8220;discover&#8221; in his own good
time.</p>
<p>His wife had left him within a year of his marriage,
and whatever investigations he may have privately
made, they were sub rosa, and he had persistently refused
to make public ones. She would come back, he
believed, with an almost childish simplicity in the lure
of his great fortune,&mdash;if she needed money,&mdash;or him.
That she should suffer real poverty or hardship, lack
the bare necessities of life, never for a moment occurred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
to him. Why should she, when his whole fortune
was at her disposal&mdash;for her personal needs?</p>
<p>People who knew him a little said he had resented
the slight to his money more than the scandal to himself
when Mrs. Masters disappeared. They were in
the wrong. Peter&#8217;s pride had been very cruelly hurt:
she had not only scorned his gold, but spurned his
affection, which was quite genuine and deep so far
as it went, but since he had never taken the world into
his confidence in the matter of his having any affection
to bestow, he as carefully kept his own counsel as to
the amount it had been hurt, and continued his life as
if the coming and going of Mrs. Masters was a matter
of as little concern as the coming or going of any
other of the immortal souls and human bodies who
got caught in the toils of the great Machine.</p>
<p>As for the expected child, let her educate it after
her own foolish, pretty fancy. When it was of an age
to understand matters, the man of Power would slip
in and claim his own, and he never doubted but that
the dazzle of his gold would outshine the vapid illusions
of the mother, and procure for him the homage
of his offspring. Such was the mingled simplicity
and cuteness of the man that he never for one moment
allowed to himself there was any other possible
reverse to this picture, this, the only thought of revenge
he harboured, its very sting to be drawn by his
own good-natured laugh at her &#8220;fancies.&#8221; So he
worked on in keen enjoyment, and the dazzle of the
gold grew brighter as the years passed away unnoticed.</p>
<p>Peter Masters sat in the innermost sanctuary of the
Temple of Mammon. It was a big corner room with
six windows facing south and east, with low projecting
balustrades outside which hid the street far down
below. The room had not a severely business-like aspect,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
it rather suggested to the observer the word business
was translatable into other meanings than work.
Thus the necessary carpet was more than a carpet in
that it was a work of Eastern art. The curtains were
more than mere hangings to exclude light or draught,
but fabrics to delight the eye. The plainness of the
walls was but a luxury to set off the admirable collection
of original sketches and clever caricatures that
adorned them. One end of the room was curtained
off to serve as a dining-room on necessity. No sybarite
could have complained of the comfort of the
chairs or the arrangement of the light. The great table
at which Peter Masters sat, was not only of the
most solid mahogany, but it was put together by an
artist in joinery&mdash;a skilful, silent servant to its owner,
offering him with a small degree of friction every possible
convenience a busy man could need. The only
other furniture in the room was a gigantic safe, or
rather a series of little safes cased in mahogany which
filled one wall like a row of school lockers, each labelled
clearly with a letter.</p>
<p>Peter Masters leant back in his chair and gazed
straight before him for one moment&mdash;just that much
space of time he allowed before the next problem of
the day came before him&mdash;then he rang one of the
row of electric bells suspended overhead.</p>
<p>Its short, imperious summons resounded directly in
the room occupied by the head clerk of the Lack Vale
Coal Company, and that worthy, without waiting to
finish the word he begun writing, slipped from his
stool and hurried to the office door of his chief, where
he knocked softly and entered in obedience to a curt
order. The room was a simplified edition of the room
on the top floor; everything was there, but in a less
luxurious degree, and the result was insignificant.
The manager of the Lack Vale Coal Company, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
sat at the table, was a hard-featured, thin-lipped man
of forty-five, with thin hair already turning grey, and
pince-nez dangling from his button hole.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Masters&#8217;s bell, sir,&#8221; said the clerk apologetically.</p>
<p>Mr. Foilet nodded and his thin lips tightened. He
gathered up a sheaf of carefully arranged papers and
went out by a private door to the central lift.</p>
<p>Peter greeted him affably and waved his hand to
the opposite chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have Bennin&#8217;s report at last?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He apologised for the delay, but thought
it useless to send it until he had investigated the gallery
itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the business of his engineers. If he is not
satisfied with them he should get others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Foilet bowed, selected a paper from the sheaf
he carried and handed it over. Peter Masters perused
it with precisely the same kindly smiling countenance
he wore when studying a paper or deciphering a
friendly epistle. It was not a friendly letter at all, it
was a curt, bald statement that a certain rich gallery
in a certain mine was unsafe for working, though the
opinion of two specialists differed on the point. The
two reports were enclosed, and when all three reports
were read Peter asked for the wage sheet of the mine.
There was no cause of complaint there.</p>
<p>&#8220;The articles of the last settlement between the firm
and the men have been rigorously adhered to?&#8221; questioned
Masters, flinging down the paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rigorously. I will say they have taken no advantage
of their success.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter smiled. &#8220;It is for us to do that. Mr. Weirs
pronounces the gallery fit for working. The seam is
one of the richest we have. What improvements can
be done to the ventilation and propping before Monday
are to be done, but the gallery is to be worked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
then, until the new shaft is completed. Then we will
reconsider it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Mr. Foilet bowed, but his hand fingered his
glasses nervously.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if the men refuse?&#8221; he questioned in a low
voice, with averted eyes.</p>
<p>Peter Masters waved his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are others. Men who receive wages like
that must expect to have a certain amount of danger
to face. Danger is the spice of life.&#8221; He leant back
in his chair, humming a little tune and watched Mr.
Foilet with smiling eyes. Mr. Foilet was wondering
whether his chief was personally fond of spice, but
he knew better than to say more. He left the room
with a vague uneasy feeling at his heart. &#8220;A nice
concern it will be if anything happens before the New
Shaft&#8217;s ready,&#8221; he muttered; &#8220;if it wasn&#8217;t for his
wonderful luck, I&#8217;d have refused.&#8221;</p>
<p>So he thought: but in reality he would have done
no such thing.</p>
<p>The manager of the Stormby Foundry, which was
a private property of Mr. Masters&#8217;s, and no company,
was the next visitor. He was a tall lank Scotchman
with a hardy countenance and a soft heart when not
fretted by the roll of the Machine. The question he
brought was concerning the selling of some land in
the neighbourhood of the works, for the erection of
cottages.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely you need no instructions on that point,
Mr. Murray,&#8221; said Peter a little more curtly than he
had spoken to Mr. Foilet.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are two offers,&#8221; said the Scotchman quietly.
&#8220;Tennant will give &pound;150 and Fortman &pound;200.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there is no question.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tennant will build decent cottages of good material and with proper foundations, and Fortman&mdash;well,
you know what Fortman&#8217;s hovels are like.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Peter drily. &#8220;He has never
been my landlord.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Murray appeared to swallow something, probably
a wish, with difficulty.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are mere hovels pretending to be villas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one&#8217;s obliged to live in them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no others,&#8221; persisted Mr. Murray desperately,
imperilling his own safety for the cause.</p>
<p>Masters frowned ominously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Murray,&#8221; he said, &#8220;as I have before remarked,
you are too far-sighted. Your work is to sell the
ground for the benefit of the company, which, I may
remind you, is for your benefit also. You have not
to build the cottages or live in them. If the people
don&#8217;t like them they needn&#8217;t take them. I do not profess
to house the people. I pay them accordingly.
They can afford to live in decent houses if they like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they can get them,&#8221; remarked the heroic Mr.
Murray.</p>
<p>Peter smiled, his anger apparently having melted
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let them arrange it with Fortman, and keep your
obstinacy for more profitable business, Murray, and
you&#8217;ll be as rich as I am some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was nothing apparently offensive in the
words, yet the speaker seemed a singularly unlovable
person as he spoke them, and Murray did not smile at
the compliment, but went out with a grave air.</p>
<p>Neither he nor his business lingered on Peter&#8217;s
mind once the door had closed behind him. Peter got
up and lounged to the window. He stood a while
looking down into the street below with its crowd of
strangely foreshortened figures. On the opposite side
of the wide street was a shop where mechanical toys
were sold, a paradise for boys. As Peter watched, a
chubby-faced, stout little man with a tall, lanky boy at
his side came to a stand before the windows. Peter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
knew the man to be one of the hardest-headed, shrewdest
men in the iron trade, and he guessed the boy was
his son. Both figures disappeared within the shop, the
elder with evident reluctance, the younger with assured
expectation. Peter waited a long time&mdash;a longer
period than he would have supposed he had to spare,
had he thought of it. They emerged at last in company
with a big parcel, hailed a hansom and drove
away. Peter looked at the clock and chuckled. &#8220;To
think Coblan is that sort of fool. Well, that youngster
will add little to the fortunes of Coblan and Company.
Toys!&#8221; He turned away from the window,
and, seated again at his desk, began to scribble down
some dates on a scrap of paper. Then he leant back in
his chair thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hibbault says that boy has just got a rise in that
berth of his in Liverpool. I&#8217;ll let him have a year or
so more to prove his grit. I suppose Hibbault&#8217;s to
be trusted, but I might write to the firm and ask how
he gets on! However, Aymer&#8217;s boy shall have the
vacancy!&#8221;</p>
<p>Therefore he took up his pen again and wrote the
following brief letter:</p>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:2.0em; text-align:right'><span style='margin-right: 0.5em;'><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Princes Building</span>, Birmingham, April 10.</span><br /></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>
<p>Despite his honest intention never to stand between
Christopher and any fate that might serve to draw
him into connection with his father, Aymer had a
hard fight to master his keen desire to put Peter&#8217;s letter
in the fire and say nothing about it. Surely, after
all, he had the best right to say what his adopted
charge&#8217;s future should be. It was he who had rescued
him from obscurity, who had lavished on him the love
and care his selfish, erratic father, for his own ambitious
ends, denied him. Aymer believed, moreover,
that a career under Peter&#8217;s influence would mean
either the blunting if not the utter destruction of every
generous and admirable quality in the boy, or a rapid
unbalanced development of those socialistic tendencies,
the seeds of which were sown by his mother and nurtured
in the hard experience of his early days. Besides
this, Peter&#8217;s interest in the boy was probably a
mere freak, or at the best, sprang from a desire to
serve his cousin, unless by any remote chance he had
stumbled on a clue to Christopher&#8217;s identity.</p>
<p>This last suspicion wove itself like a black thread
into the grey woof of Aymer&#8217;s existence. His whole
being by now had become concentrated in the boy&#8217;s
life. It was a renewal of youth, hopes, ambitions,
again possible in the person of this child, and for the
second time a fierce, restless jealousy of his cousin began
to stir in the inner depths of Aymer&#8217;s being, as
fire which may yet break into life beneath the grey,
piled-up ashes which conceal it.</p>
<p>He sought help and advice from none and fought
hard alone for his own salvation through the long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
watches of a black night&mdash;fought against the jealousy
that prompted him to hedge Christopher about with
precautions and restrictions which, however desirable
they might seem to his finite wisdom, yet were, he
knew, only the outcome of his smouldering jealousy,
and might well grow to formidable barriers for Christopher
to climb in later years. Aymer fought, too, for
that sense of larger faith that in the midst of careful
action yet leaves room for the hand of God and does
not confound the little ideas of the builder with the
vast plan of the Great Architect.</p>
<p>So the letter&mdash;the little fact which stood for such
great possibilities&mdash;was shown to Christopher, to
whom it was a mere nothing, to be tossed aside with
scorn.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be under him,&#8221; he commented indignantly,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t care about his old axles,&#8221; and
then because C&aelig;sar was silent and he felt himself in
the wrong, he apologised.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the same, I don&#8217;t want to go to him unless you
particularly wish it, C&aelig;sar,&#8221; he insisted.</p>
<p>But C&aelig;sar did not answer directly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are certain you want to be an engineer?&#8221; he
asked at length.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certain,&mdash;only&mdash;&#8221; Christopher stopped, went over
to the window and looked out.</p>
<p>They were in London and it was an evening in
early spring. There was a faint primrose glow in the
sky and a blackbird was whistling at the end of the
garden. The hum of the great town was as part of
the silence of the room.</p>
<p>Now at last must come the moment when Christopher
must speak plainly of his darling purpose that
had been striving for expression these many months,
that purpose which had grown out of a childish fancy
in the long ago days when his mother and he toiled
along the muddy wearisome roads, or wended painfully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
through choking white dust under a blazing
sun&#8211;&#8211;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;Mother, how does roads get made here in the
country, are they made like in London?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Jim, they were made somewhere by men, not
over well, I think, for walkers such as we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make roads when I&#8217;m big,&#8221; announced Jim,
&#8220;real good ones that you can walk on easily.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>So Christopher broke his purpose to C&aelig;sar abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to be a Road Engineer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A Roadmaker. To make high roads,&mdash;not in
towns, but across countries. Roads that will be easy
to travel on and will last.&#8221; Again he stopped, embarrassed,
for the vision before him which he only half
saw, made him hot and confused. Yet it was a good
vision, perhaps that was why&mdash;a picture of countless
toiling human beings travelling on his roads all down
the coming ages, knowing them for good roads, and
praising the maker. But he was a boy and was
abashed at the vision and hoped C&aelig;sar did not guess
at it. C&aelig;sar, however, saw it all more clearly than
Christopher himself and was not abashed but well
content.</p>
<p>The boy went back to C&aelig;sar&#8217;s side. The thing was
done, spoken of, made alive, and now he could plead
for it, work to gain his end,&mdash;also there was a glow
in his face and a new eagerness in his manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, C&aelig;sar, do say it&#8217;s possible. I always wanted
to do it, even when I was a little chap, and watched
men breaking stones on the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite possible, only it will want working out.
You must go abroad&mdash;France&mdash;Germany&mdash;I must see
where to place you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I must learn how they are made everywhere,
and then&mdash;then there must be roads to be made somewhere&mdash;in
new countries if not here.&#8221;</p>
<p>They talked it out earnestly; C&aelig;sar himself caught
the boy&#8217;s enthusiasm, and the moment Mr. Aston
came in he too was drawn into the discussion and offered
good advice.</p>
<p>Thus Christopher&#8217;s future was decided upon as
something to be worked out quite independent of
Peter Masters and his millions. Perhaps because he
had seen the vision which covered Christopher with
shy confusion, Aymer became very prosaic and practical
over the details, and Mr. Aston was the only one
of the trio who gave any more thought to the boy&#8217;s
dream on its sentimental side. He used to sit in the
evenings watching the two poring over maps, letters
and guidebooks, thinking far thoughts for them both,
occasionally uttering them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; he remarked one night, &#8220;if you know
what a lucky young man you are, Master Christopher,
not only in having a real wish concerning your own
future&mdash;which is none too common a lot&mdash;but in being
free to follow it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher looked up from the map he was studying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know I&#8217;m lucky, St. Michael. It must be
perfectly horrible to have to be something one does not
want to be. I suppose that&#8217;s why lots of people never
get on in the world. It seems beastly unfair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet I&#8217;ve known men to succeed at work for which
they had no original aptitude,&#8221; returned Mr. Aston
quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mightn&#8217;t they have succeeded better at what they
did like?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is beside the mark, so that they did not fail
altogether. I knew a soldier once,&#8221; he went on
dreamily, &#8220;just a private. A good chap. He was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
soldier because he was born and bred in the midst of
a regiment, but his one passion was music. He taught
himself a little instead of learning his drill. In the
end he deserted and joined a German band. That
argues nothing for his musical taste, you say. He
just thought it a stepping-stone, but it was a tombstone.
He was quite a smart soldier, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think it was jolly hard lines on him to
have to be a soldier at all, if he didn&#8217;t like it. He
wanted a C&aelig;sar to help him out. I think all fellows
ought to have a chance, there should be someone or
something to say, &#8216;what do you want to be?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d be surprised how few could answer. Prove
your point yourself anyway, my dear boy. Succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean to,&#8221; said Christopher with shut teeth and
an intonation that reminded both men of Peter Masters
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are all of us Roadmakers of one kind or
another,&#8221; went on Mr. Aston meditatively, &#8220;making
the way rougher or smoother for those who come after
us. Happy if we only succeed in rolling in a few
of the stones that hurt our own feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>are</i> rather like a steam roller,&#8221; remarked
Aymer quietly, &#8220;it hadn&#8217;t struck me before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Aston rumpled his hair distractedly and Christopher
giggled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t talking of myself at all,&#8221; said Mr. Aston
hastily. &#8220;I was merely thinking of you making things
smooth for Christopher. You are much more
like a steam roller than I am. You are bigger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher began to laugh helplessly, and Aymer
protested rather indignantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I deny the likeness. But if rolling has to be done,
it is better to do it heavily, I suppose. Whose roads
shall we roll, Christopher?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher looked up, suddenly grave.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, C&aelig;sar?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You say everyone should have a chance and my
father insists we are bound by some unknown Board
of Guardians to level our neighbours&#8217; roads, so where
will you start?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On Sam Sartin!&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat upright, his face glowing, looking straight
at C&aelig;sar. C&aelig;sar&#8217;s tone might be flippant, but if he
meant what Christopher supposed him to mean, he
must not let the golden opportunity slip.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought Sam was in a greengrocer&#8217;s shop,&#8221; said
C&aelig;sar in a drawling, indifferent manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;So he is. But would anyone be in a greengrocer&#8217;s
shop if they could be in anything else? When we
were kids, he and I, we used to plan we&#8217;d be Lord
Mayors&mdash;A greengrocer!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An honest and respectable calling, if a little dirty,&#8221;
murmured Mr. Aston. &#8220;The greengrocers, I mean
not the Lord Mayors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sam&#8217;s got a head on his shoulders. He&#8217;s really
awfully sharp. He could be anything he liked,&#8221; urged
Christopher. &#8220;Could you help him, C&aelig;sar?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might if you liked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make what I like of him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Most emphatically, no. Make what he likes
of himself. A crossing sweeper, if he fancies that.
Buy him a crossing and a broom, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But really, what he likes; not joking?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sober earnest. I&#8217;ll see to-morrow, and tell you.
Now, will you kindly find that place you were looking
for when we were so inopportunely interrupted with
irrelevant moralisings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t do it again,&#8221; said his father deprecatingly.
&#8220;I apologise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer gravely bowed his head and the subject was
dropped. But when they were alone that evening,
Mr. Aston reverted to it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with Sam Sartin?&#8221; he
asked, &#8220;and why are you doing it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sam must settle the first question himself,&#8221; said
Aymer, idly drawing appalling pictures of steamrollers
on the fly-leaf of a book, &#8220;as to the second&mdash;&#8221;
he paused in his drawing, put the book down and
turned to his father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christopher&#8217;s got the makings of a rabid socialist
in him. If he&#8217;s not given good data to go on he will
be a full disciple when he&#8217;s twenty-one, all theories
and dreams, caught in a mesh of words. I don&#8217;t want
that. It&#8217;s natural too, for, after all, Christopher is
not of the People, any more than&mdash;than his mother
was.&#8221; He examined his pencil critically. &#8220;She always
credited them with the fine aspirations and pure
passions of her own soul, instead of allowing them
the very reasonable and just aspirations and ambitions
that they have and should be able to reach. Sam may
be an exception, but I don&#8217;t think he is. I&#8217;m quite
ready to give Christopher a free hand to help him, provided
he knows what he wants himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To provide an object lesson for Christopher?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, precisely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it quite fair on Sam?&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer looked up quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He benefits anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly; but you do not care about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Christopher <ins class="trnote" title="Transcriber&amp;#8217;s Note: changed single quote mark to a double quote mark">does.&#8221;</ins></p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes. Christopher does. That is worth considering.
Otherwise&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Otherwise?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How far are we justified in experimenting with
our fellow-creatures, I wonder?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>
<p>It was a day of expectancy&mdash;and promise&mdash;of blackthorn
breaking into snowy showers, and of meadows
richly green, blue sky and white cloud&mdash;and a sense
of racing, headlong life joyously tremulous over the
earth.</p>
<p>The boys had met at Paddington Station, Sam Sartin
by no means abashed at his own appearance in
an old suit of Christopher&#8217;s, and wearing, in deference
to his friend&#8217;s outspoken wishes, a decorous dark-blue
tie and unobtrusive shirt. He looked what he was&mdash;a
good, solid, respectable working lad out for a holiday.
Excitement, if he felt it, was well suppressed, surprise
at the new world of luxury&mdash;they travelled down first&mdash;was
equally carefully concealed. The code of manners
in which he was reared was stringent in this
particular.</p>
<p>Christopher, on the contrary, was in high spirits.
Sam had watched him come down the platform, out
of the corner of his eye, with a queer sense of proud
possession. He would have liked to proclaim to the
world that the young master there, who walked like
a prince, was his own particular pal. Yet he pretended
not to see him till Christopher clapped him on the
shoulder with a warm greeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got the tickets. Come on,&#8221; said the giver of
the treat. &#8220;I say, what a day, Sammie&mdash;if it&#8217;s good
in London what will it be in the country?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cold, I shouldn&#8217;t wonder. What&#8217;s the matter
with London?&#8221; said the cockney sarcastically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Bricks and Mortar,&#8221; retorted Christopher
gaily. &#8220;You&#8217;ll know what&#8217;s the matter with it when
you come back. It&#8217;s too jolly small.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Big enough for me. But the country&#8217;s well
enough to play in. I say, Mr. Christopher, I&#8217;ve been
thinking, we may not find any boats. It&#8217;s early.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve seen to that,&#8221; said Christopher with the
faintest suspicion of lordliness in his voice. &#8220;I wrote
to the man I know at Maidenhead to have a boat ready&mdash;a
good one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam grinned. &#8220;My, what a head-piece we&#8217;ve got,
to be sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other flushed a little. &#8220;It was really C&aelig;sar
who suggested it,&#8221; he owned.</p>
<p>Sam had never been down that line before, so Christopher
pointed out the matters of interest. They
found their boat ready at Maidenhead, bestowed their
coats in the bow and settled themselves. Christopher
insisted on Sam&#8217;s rowing stroke. Sam thought politeness
obliged him to refuse, but he ultimately gave
in. He retrieved the little error in manners by handling
his oar in a masterly way. &#8220;Stroke shaping
well,&#8221; Christopher heard the boatman say as they
went off.</p>
<p>The wind on the river was cold enough and, in
spite of the bright sun, cut through them. But half
an hour&#8217;s steady pulling brought them into a glow
and mood to enjoy themselves. Christopher called
for a rest. Sam looked over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tired?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; responded the other, laughing, &#8220;but we
didn&#8217;t come down just to row &#8216;eyes in boat&#8217;; I want
to look at the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing but green fields and trees and cows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like cows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless he desisted from work, and they
drifted on. Christopher was bubbling over with a
great secret that was to be the crowning episode of
the day. It would be fatal to divulge it too early, so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
he plunged into friendly discussions and they rowed
on happy in the physical exertion, the clean, fresh air
and the smiling earth.</p>
<p>It was not till after lunch that Christopher decided
the great matter must be broached, to allow time to
discuss it in full detail. They had changed places and
he was stroke now. He pulled with a slower swing
but greater power than Sam and for some time bent to
his work in silence, thinking over what he was going
to say. He took a rapid mental survey of Sam&#8217;s present
life and future, of what it held and more especially
of what it did not hold; the limitations, the lack of
opportunity, the struggle for existence that left no
room for ambitions or hopes. And he, with C&aelig;sar&#8217;s
help, was going to change all that, and open the gates
of the world wide for him. If the thought were exhilarating,
it had also a serious side. He was not
afraid, he was too young for that, but he had sense
enough to know it was a big thing to uproot a life
and plant it in a new spot more congenial to growth.</p>
<p>Mr. Aston&#8217;s words to him that morning came back
with puzzling insistence. &#8220;Remember,&#8221; he had said
in his kindly way, &#8220;no two people see life through
the same glasses. Don&#8217;t be surprised if Sam&#8217;s make
you squint.&#8221; What did he mean? It was just because
he, Christopher, was not sure of Sam&#8217;s real ambition
that he was to be given the choice. He amused
himself while cogitating over it, tasting like an epicure
the flavour of the good wine to be drunk presently.
Sam complained he was a bad stroke, and they
changed again. This better suited his plans. He
could see the town boy&#8217;s thin sloping shoulders bend
evenly before him. Sam was no athlete in build, but
his passion for rowing had stood him in good stead
and developed muscle and endurance.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll choose something in boats,&#8221; thought Christopher,
mentally picturing Sam as captain of a great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
liner and then as an alternative, as an admiral of the
Fleet, and so came the crucial point.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sam, if you had your choice, what would you
be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But think. I want to know. A greengrocer like
Mr. Gruner? Ho, ho!&#8221; he shouted out wholesome
laughter.</p>
<p>Sam grinned. He was less ready to laugh. Life
had taken toll of that birthright already.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate vegetables. Beastly, dirty things,&#8221; he said
prosaically. &#8220;No, I wouldn&#8217;t be a <i>green</i>-grocer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well what? An engineer? A doctor, lawyer,
parson?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not a king now?&#8221; scoffed Sam.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not enough situations vacant. I mean it, really.
What would you be if you were as free to choose as
I am?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I were you, you mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not that. If you could choose for yourself
as I have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam rowed on stolidly. &#8220;Dunno that it&#8217;s much
use bothering,&#8221; he said indifferently. &#8220;I&#8217;m doing all
right, though it&#8217;s not what I&#8217;d choose.&#8221;</p>
<p>It had seemed an easy, insignificant task to break
the news five minutes ago, but either Christopher had
taken the wrong approach or it was a stiffer job than
he had fancied. He became uneasily conscious his
own part in it could not be overlooked, that he was
doing something that evilly-disposed persons might
even call magnanimous or philanthropic. His face
grew red at the thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sam,&#8221; he said as naturally as he could, &#8220;it happens
you can choose, you see. Choose anything you
like. C&aelig;sar&#8217;s given me a free hand. We are both
to start life just as we like. What shall it be? I&#8217;ve
told you my choice.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>The narrow form in front never slackened its
stroke, but pulled on mechanically, and at last spoke
a little gruffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say. You&#8217;re kidding me, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not. Dead earnest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the boat shot on, but Christopher stopped
rowing. Sam looked back over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re lazy. Why don&#8217;t you pull?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher obeyed mechanically. He knew he
could afford to be patient now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy,&#8221; said the stroke at last.</p>
<p>There was a smooth reach of water before them.
Low meadows with reddish muddy banks lay on either
side, no house or any living soul was in sight. Sam
rubbed his hands on his trousers, looked back at his
friend and away again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean you&#8217;ll start me in any trade I like?
&#8217;Prentice me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any trade or profession.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you do it for, anyhow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;C&aelig;sar suggested it. He said I might if I liked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, why do you do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does it matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to know certain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher looked embarrassed. &#8220;Weren&#8217;t we
kids together? Besides, it seems to me every chap
ought to have a chance of working on the job he likes
best. It&#8217;s only fair. It&#8217;s jolly rough on a fellow to
have to do just what comes along whether he&#8217;s fit for
it or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to me,&#8221; said Sam meditatively, &#8220;a good
many jobs would want doing if everyone did what
they liked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, science would step in and equalise that,&#8221; returned
Christopher, hastily quoting from some handbook
and went on to further expound his creed.</p>
<p>Sam concluded he had been listening to spouters in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
the Park, but he was sharp enough to recognise beneath
the crude boyish creed the kindly generous nature
that prompted it.</p>
<p>&#8220;So C&aelig;sar says you&#8217;ve just to choose. We&#8217;ll see
you through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must be jolly rich.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s rich, isn&#8217;t it, to be able to
do things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what he gets out of it anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t want anything, you silly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to think this out,&#8221; said Sam, &#8220;there is
something I&#8217;ve always wanted since I was a kiddy, but
I want to think. Row on.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was intelligible and encouraging. Christopher&#8217;s
sense of flatness gave way a little. He pulled
steadily, trying to make out what had so dashed him
in Sam&#8217;s reception of the great news. He had not
yet learnt how exceptional is the mind that can accept
a favour graciously.</p>
<p>After nearly ten minutes&#8217; silence Sam spoke again.
&#8220;Well, then, I&#8217;d like to be a grocer,&#8221; and straightway
pulled furiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; gasped Christopher, feeling the bottom
story of his card house tottering to a fall.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like this. I don&#8217;t mind telling you&mdash;much&mdash;though
I&#8217;ve never told nobody before. When I was
a bit of a chap, mother, she used to take me out shopping
in the evenings. We went to pokey little shops,
but we used to pass a fine, big shop&mdash;four glass windows&mdash;it
has six now&mdash;and great lights and mahogany
counters and little rails, and balls for change,
tiled floor, no sawdust. Every time I saw it I says to
myself, &#8216;When I&#8217;m a man I&#8217;ll have a place like that.&#8217;
I tried to get a job there, but I couldn&#8217;t&mdash;they made
too many family inquiries, you see,&#8221; he added bitterly;
&#8220;well, if I could get &#8217;prenticed to a place like that
... might be head man some day....&#8221; He began
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
whistling with forced indifference, queerly conscious
that the whole of his life seemed packed in that little
boat&mdash;waiting. The boat had drifted into a side
eddy. Christopher sat with his head on his hands,
wondering with his surface consciousness if the planks
at his feet were three or four inches wide, but at last
he brushed aside the last card of his demolished palace
and recalled his promise to C&aelig;sar to leave Sam
as free and unbiased in choice as he had been
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be quite easy to manage,&#8221; he said with
assumed heartiness, &#8220;it&#8217;s&mdash;only too easy. Only you
must be a partner or something. Oh, oh. A white
apron. I&#8217;ll buy my tea and bacon of you when I&#8217;ve
a house of my own!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; grinned Sam. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have great rows
of red and gold canisters and&mdash;and brass fittings
everywhere&mdash;not your plated stuff for me&mdash;solid brass
and marble-topped counters. But it won&#8217;t come off,&#8221;
he added dejectedly, &#8220;things like that never do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it will,&#8221; persisted Christopher impatiently,
&#8220;just as my going to Dusseldorf is coming off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t get &#8217;prenticed for nothing,&#8221; was the
faithless rejoinder.</p>
<p>Christopher joggled the boat and shouted: &#8220;You
sinner, if you won&#8217;t take my word for it I&#8217;ll smash
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right&mdash;keep cool, I&#8217;m only having you on,
Chris. Oughtn&#8217;t we to turn now?&#8221;</p>
<p>They expended their excitement and emotion in
rowing furiously, and landed again at Maidenhead in
time for tea. Then Christopher broke the further
news to Sam that he was to return with him to Aston
House and see C&aelig;sar. He overcame with difficulty
Sam&#8217;s reiterated objections, and they walked from
Paddington, Christopher keeping a strict guard over
Sam lest he should escape.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>But Sam&#8217;s objections were more &#8220;code&#8221; than genuine.
He was really anxious to hear the wonderful
news confirmed by more responsible lips than Christopher&#8217;s&mdash;not
that he disbelieved his intentions, but
he still doubted his powers. He grew very silent,
however, as they turned in at the beautiful iron gates
of Aston House. He had never managed to really
connect his old friend with this wonderful dignified
residence that he knew vaguely by sight. He had
had dim visions of Christopher slipping in by a side
entrance avoiding the eyes of plush-breeched lords-in-waiting.
But here was that young gentleman marching
calmly in at the big front doors nodding cheerfully
to the sober-clad man waiting in the hall who
called Christopher &#8220;Sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam successfully concealed under an expression of
solid matter-of-factness the interest and curiosity that
consumed him. He looked straight before him and
yet saw all round. He accepted the whole calmly, but
he wanted to sit down and stare.</p>
<p>Christopher explained that they were to have dinner
together in his own sitting-room as soon as they had
seen Aymer.</p>
<p>They went through the swing doors down the long
corridor leading to Aymer&#8217;s room, and Christopher
stopped for a moment near a window.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never come down here in this sort of light,&#8221; he
said with a little catch in his voice, &#8220;without thinking
of the first evening I came. How big it all seemed
and how quiet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is quiet,&#8221; said Sam in a subdued whisper.</p>
<p>In another moment they were in Aymer&#8217;s room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, C&aelig;sar. Here we are, turned up like bad
pennies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher pulled Sam across the room to the sofa.
Sam would have been not a little surprised had he
known that it cost Aymer Aston a great deal more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
effort to see a new face than it cost him to look at
this C&aelig;sar of whom he had heard so much.</p>
<p>The &#8220;code&#8221; slipped from his mental horizon and
left him red and embarrassed, watching Christopher
furtively to see what he would do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s Sam, C&aelig;sar. I&#8217;ve told you all about him
and he may just have heard your name mentioned&mdash;possibly&mdash;&#8221; laughed
Christopher seating himself on
the sofa and indicating a chair to his friend.</p>
<p>Aymer held out his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve heard of you, Sam. Sit down, won&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam sat down, his hands on his knees, and tried to
find a safe spot on which to focus his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, isn&#8217;t it a jolly room,&#8221; began Christopher
triumphantly, &#8220;didn&#8217;t I tell you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s big,&#8221; said Sam cautiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christopher, behave yourself. Don&#8217;t mind his
bad manners, Sam. It&#8217;s sheer nervousness on his
part, he can&#8217;t help it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A newspaper was flung dexterously across his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which gives point to my remark,&#8221; continued Aymer,
calmly folding it. &#8220;Well, have you enjoyed your
day? Madness, I call it, the river in March!&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher plunged into an account of their jaunt
to which his companion listened in complete bewilderment,
hardly recognising the simple pleasures of their
holiday in their dress of finished detail and humour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that a true account?&#8221; asked Aymer, catching
the tail of a broad grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see the water-rat dressing himself, or the
girl with the red shoes,&#8221; said Sam slowly. &#8220;My,
what a chap you are, Christopher, to spin a yarn.
Wish I could reel it off to mother and the kids like
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>He found himself in a few minutes discoursing with
Aymer on the variety and history of his family. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
was not for some minutes or so that the great subject
was approached.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; said Aymer at last, &#8220;I need not ask
if you and Christopher have been discussing his little
plan for your future. What do you think of it, Sam?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher got up and walked to the window.
Minute by minute a sense of overwhelming disappointment
and shame obliterated the once plausible
idea. It was not only an opportunity missed, it was
wasted, thrown away. What glory or distinctions,
what ambitions could be fulfilled in the narrow confines
of a grocer&#8217;s shop&mdash;a nightmare vision of an
interminable vista of red canisters, mahogany counters,
biscuit boxes and marble slabs, swam before his
eyes. It was no use denying it. It was a cruel disappointment ... and
what would C&aelig;sar think?</p>
<p>Meanwhile Sam, in answer to Aymer&#8217;s questions,
had stumbled out the statement he thought it a rattling
fine thing for him and was very much obliged.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you know your own mind on the point?&#8221; demanded
Aymer, watching him closely.</p>
<p>Sam coughed nervously. &#8220;Yes, I always knew
what I wanted to be. I told him,&#8221; with a backward
jerk of his head towards Christopher.</p>
<p>This was better than Aymer had expected. A boy
with an ambition and a mind of his own was worth
assisting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what is it. Will you tell me too?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam looked at him out of the corner of his shrewd
eyes. &#8220;It&#8217;s you as is really doing it, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like this,&#8221; began Sam, hesitating; &#8220;it costs
money,&mdash;my top ambition; but it&#8217;s a paying thing and
if anyone would be kind enough to start me on it I&#8217;d
work off the money in time. I know I could.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid Christopher hasn&#8217;t quite explained,&#8221;
said Aymer quietly; &#8220;it&#8217;s not a question of investing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
money on your industry. I don&#8217;t expect him to pay
back the cost of starting him in life. You are to start
on precisely the same ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam got red. &#8220;He&mdash;he belongs to you&mdash;it&#8217;s different,&#8221;
he began.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your ambition?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Grocery business. I&#8217;ve told him. Ever since I
was a bit of a chap that high I&#8217;ve wanted it. I never
could get a job in a shop, but if I was regularly apprenticed
now&mdash;if that wasn&#8217;t too much?&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer&#8217;s glance meandered thoughtfully to the distant
Christopher, still staring out of the window; a
shadow of a smile rose to his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that would not be difficult to manage, Sam.
How old are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Over sixteen, sir. There&#8217;s money in grocery, sir.
I could pay it back. I&#8217;m sure I could.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer lay still, thinking. &#8220;What sort of schooling
have you had? Not much? Passed the fifth
standard young?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it takes a long time for a &#8217;prentice to work
up,&#8221; said Sam, watching him eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking of another way,&#8221; said Aymer slowly.
&#8220;Christopher.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rejoined them, standing by the grate and kicking
the logs into place. He did not look at Aymer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sam has been telling me of his wishes,&#8221; said Aymer.
&#8220;I think them quite excellent, but I&#8217;ve not
quite decided on the best way to carry them out. Go
away and get your dinner and come back to me afterwards.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys departed, and once in Christopher&#8217;s den,
the host turned to his guest questioningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what do you think of C&aelig;sar?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a stunner, a jolly sight more sensible than
you, Chris. But I say,&#8221; he added in a grumpy, husky
voice, &#8220;is he always like that?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Like what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On a sofa. Lying down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Christopher shortly. He had become
almost as sensitive on that point as Aymer himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;He must get a bit tired of it. Didn&#8217;t he ever
walk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course. It was a shooting accident. Shut
up, Sam, we all hate talking of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dinner that was served immediately somehow
impressed Sam more than any other event of the day.
He had occasionally had a meal in a restaurant with
Christopher, and once had been in a dining-room at
an hotel, but it all seemed different to this intimate,
comfortable dinner. The white napery, the shining
silver and delicate glass and china, the serving of the
simple meal was a revelation of his friend&#8217;s life, for
Christopher took it all as a matter of course and was
unabashed by the presence of the second footman who
waited on them.</p>
<p>There was soup, and cutlets in little paper dresses,
tomatoes and potatoes that bore no resemblance to
the grimy vegetables Sam dispensed daily. Then
came strange bird-shaped things, about the size of
sparrows which Christopher called chicken and which
had no bones in them, cherry tart, with innumerable
trifles with it, afterwards something that looked like
a solid browny-yellow cake, which gave way to nothing
when cut, and tasted of cheese. Finally there was
fruit, that was a crowning point, for Sam knew what
pears cost that time of year, and said so.</p>
<p>Christopher laughed. &#8220;These come from Marden,&#8221;
he explained. &#8220;Marden&#8217;s noted for pears; they have
storages of different temperatures and keep them back
or ripen them as wanted. The fire&#8217;s jolly after all,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>He stretched out his long legs to the fender, a very
contented young Sybarite for the moment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Chris,&#8221; said Sam abruptly, &#8220;I must tell
you though you&#8217;ll think it pretty low of me. But after
you came and told us you were living here with
Mr. Aston I used to ask people about him. One day
I came round here and ... somehow I never took
it in. I knew in a way you lived here, but I didn&#8217;t
know it was like this....&#8221; He stumbled over his
words in an embarrassed fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like what?&#8221; demanded Christopher shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I thought you was here like a sort of servant&mdash;not
with them exactly&mdash;I see now, I never took
it in before&mdash;you with your own rooms and walking
in at the front door and ordering dinner and
them blokes in the hall saying &#8216;sir&#8217; to you&mdash;oh,
lor&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you they had adopted me,&#8221; said the other,
frowning and rather red.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to have taken it in, but I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; continued
Sam humbly, &#8220;and then you ask me here&mdash;and
are going to give me a chance&mdash;Oh, lor&#8217;,&mdash;what&#8217;s
it all for, I want to know? What does it mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher got up and walked away. Had Sam
but known it, his chance in life was in dire peril at
that moment. Seldom had Christopher felt so angry
and never had he felt so out of touch with his companion.
Why on earth couldn&#8217;t Sam take his luck
without wanting reasons. It was so preposterous, in
Christopher&#8217;s eyes, to want any. In the old days Sam
had been ready to share his scant pennies and toys
with his small friend. The offer of a ride in a van
from the warehouse where Sartin senior worked
would have included both of them or neither. What
was the difference? What was the use of having
plenty if not to share it with a friend?</p>
<p>To his credit he did not allow Sam to guess his irritation,
but suggested a return to C&aelig;sar&#8217;s room.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t it take you an awful long time to get used
to all this?&#8221; inquired Sam, as he followed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I forget. No, I don&#8217;t though. I hated it rather
at first, the clothes and collars and having to change
and be tidy, and all that, but I soon got used to it.
Here we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Aston was there too now. Sam was duly introduced
and behaved with great discretion. He was far
less abashed by Mr. Aston than by Aymer, whose
physical condition produced a shyness not inherent in
the youth.</p>
<p>Mr. Aston talked to him in a friendly gossiping way,
then looked across at Aymer with a faint nod.</p>
<p>Aymer unfolded his scheme of carrying out Sam&#8217;s
ambitions to a fruitful end. He was to go for a year
to a commercial school, and after that to be put
into a good firm as pupil or &#8217;prentice with a chance of
becoming a junior partner with a small capital if he
did well.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t do well, of course it&#8217;s off,&#8221; concluded
Aymer, rather wearily, &#8220;the future is in your hands,
not ours: we only supply an opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam said stolidly he quite understood that: that he
was much obliged, and he&#8217;d do his best.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be a race between you,&#8221; remarked Mr. Aston,
looking from one boy to the other, &#8220;as to whether
you become a full-fledged grocer first or Christopher
a full-fledged engineer.&#8221;</p>
<p>But late that night when Mr. Aston was bidding
Aymer good-night, he remarked as he stood looking
down at him:</p>
<p>&#8220;You have done a good piece of road-making to-day,
old man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t,&#8221; retorted Aymer, rather crossly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve only supplied material for someone else to use
if they like.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Just to please Christopher?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Aymer did not answer that. Mr. Aston really
needed no answer, for he knew that long ago Sam&#8217;s
mother had made smooth a very rough piece of road
for another woman&#8217;s feet, and that woman was Christopher&#8217;s
mother.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>
<p>A thin, sickly-looking woman in a dingy black dress
sat by the roadside with a basket of bootlaces and buttons
at her feet. She rested her elbows on her knees
and gazed with unseeing eyes at the meadowland
below.</p>
<p>The burst shoe, the ragged gown, and unkempt head
proclaimed her a Follower of the Road, and the sordid
wretchedness that reached its lowest depth in lack of
desire for better things, was a sight to force Philanthropist
or Socialist to sink differences in one energetic
struggle to eradicate the type. If she thought at all it
was in the dumb, incoherent manner of her class: at
the actual moment a vision of a hat with red flowers
she had seen in a shop window flickered across her
mind, chased away by a hazy wonder as to how much
supper threepence halfpenny would provide. That
thought, too, fell away before a sudden, shrewd calculation
as to the possible harvest to be gleaned from
the two people just coming over the brow of the hill.</p>
<p>These two, a boy and a young man, were walking
with the swinging step and assurance of those who
have never bent before grim need.</p>
<p>&#8220;Young toffs,&#8221; she decided, and wondered if it
were worth while getting up or not.</p>
<p>The young man was listening eagerly to the equally
eager chatter of his companion, and they walked
quickly as those who were in haste to reach a goal until
they were level with the tramp woman, who watched
them with speculative eyes. The boy, who was about
twelve years old, was as good a specimen of a well-trained,
well-nurtured boy as one might find in the
country, the product of generations of careful selection
and high ideals, active, brimming over with vitality
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
and joyousness, with clear-cut features perhaps a trifle
too pronounced for his age. But the elder of the two,
who was twenty-one and might by appearance have
been some few years older, was a far stronger type.
There was a certain steady strength in the set of his
square head, in the straight look of his dark eyes. It
was a face that might in time be over-stern if the
kindly humorous lines of the mouth should fade. The
tramp woman saw nothing of this. She only observed
their absorption in each other and abandoned hope of
adding to her meagre fortune.</p>
<p>Max Aston&#8217;s quick blue eyes saw her and were
averted instantly, for she was not a pleasing object.
But at sight of her the shadow of some dominant
thought drove every expression from his companion&#8217;s
face but pity: and the pity of the strong for the weak
lies near to reverence.</p>
<p>He crossed the road abruptly, his hand in his pocket.
Max dawdled after him. The woman looked up with
awakened interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long road, kind sir, and poor weather,&#8221; she
began in a professional drawl, and then stopped. The
young face looking down on her had something in its
expression to which she was not accustomed. It was
as if he checked her begging for very shame. She
noticed dully, he held his cap in his hand.</p>
<p>He said nothing at all, but dropped a coin in her
hand and went on, followed by Max, who was a little
puzzled.</p>
<p>The woman looked after them and forgot she had
not thanked him. She wished the moment would repeat
itself and the young gentleman stand before her
again. She had not taken it all in&mdash;taken <i>what</i> in, she
hardly knew.</p>
<p>She looked at the coin and it gleamed yellow in her
hand. It was half a sovereign. Oh, what luck, what
luck! It was a mistake of course&mdash;he had thought it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
was a sixpence no doubt, but he had gone, and she
had it.</p>
<p>A vista of unlikely comforts opened before her, even
the hat with red flowers was possible. It was careless
of him though.</p>
<p>She got up suddenly and looked down the hill. The
two were still in sight&mdash;the boy had stopped to tie his
boot-lace.</p>
<p>She looked at the half-sovereign again, and then set
off at a shuffling slipshod trot after them. They had
resumed their walk before she reached them, but the
boy looking back, saw her, and told the other, who
wheeled round sharply, frowning a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ere, please sir, I wants to see yer,&#8221; she gasped,
out of breath, choking a little with unwonted exertion.
Christopher went back to her and waited gravely.
She opened her hand and the half-sovereign glinted
again in the light.</p>
<p>&#8220;Expect yer made a mistake, didn&#8217;t yer, sir?&#8221; she
asked in a hoarse whisper, and saw a wave of hot colour
under his brown skin.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said awkwardly, &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t anything else.
It was good of you to trouble to come though. Go and
get some new boots and a good supper. It&#8217;s bad going
on the roads in autumn. I <i>know</i>, I&#8217;ve done it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gasped at him bewildered, her hand still open.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yer a gentleman, yer are,&#8221;&mdash;her tone hesitated as
it were between the statement of a plain fact and doubt
of his last words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Winchester is three miles on. You can get decent
lodgings out by the Station Road to the left as you go
under the arch. Good-bye.&#8221; He raised his hat again
and turned away. The woman looked after him, gave
a prolonged sniff and limped back up the hill.</p>
<p>Max looked at Christopher out of the corner of his
eye, a little doubtfully. He had not come near, fastidiousness
outweighing curiosity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What did she want&mdash;and why did you take your
hat off?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher grew hot again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s a woman, and my mother and I tramped,
you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Max did not know, and intimated that Christopher
was talking rot.</p>
<p>Christopher decapitated a thistle and explained
briefly, &#8220;C&aelig;sar adopted me straight out of a workhouse.
My mother and I were tramping from London
to Southampton, and she got ill at Whitmansworth, the
other side of Winchester, and died there. The Union
kept me till Mr. Aston took me away. I thought
everyone knew.&#8221;</p>
<p>Embarrassment and curiosity struggled for the mastery
in the young aristocrat by his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you really did tramp?&#8221; he ventured at length.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, for a time, but we were not like that. My
mother was&mdash;was a lady, educated, and all that, I
think, only quite poor. She understood poor people
and tramps. We used to walk with them, talk to them.
They were kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if C&aelig;sar hadn&#8217;t adopted you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be a workhouse porter by now, perhaps,&#8221;
laughed Christopher lightly and then was silent. A picture
of the possible or rather of the inevitable swam
before his eyes; a picture of a hungry, needy soul compassed
by wants, by fierce desires, with the dominant
will to fulfil them and no means, and the world against
him. He did not reason it out to a logical conclusion,
but he saw it clearly.</p>
<p>Max concluded the subject was not to be discussed
and went on with an explanation of why Christopher
had not been met in state after four years&#8217;
absence.</p>
<p>&#8220;The motor was to come for you, but it&#8217;s gone
wrong, and Aymer said you&#8217;d rather walk than drive,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
and we were not quite certain of the train. Do you
really hate driving, Christopher?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I always think the horses will run away.
Aymer knows that. Is it really four years since I was
here, Max?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, at Christmas. You never came down when
you were in town two years ago. It was a beastly
shame of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d only two months and C&aelig;sar wanted me. That
was before I went to Switzerland, wasn&#8217;t it? They
know something about road-making there, Max, but
I&#8217;ve learnt more in France.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And all about motors, too?&#8221; questioned Max
eagerly. &#8220;Can you really drive one?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;ve won a race or two, and
I&#8217;ve got a certificate. Perhaps it won&#8217;t pass in England.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you teach me to drive? I just long to: but
St. Michael says no&mdash;though he doesn&#8217;t mind Geoffry
Leverson teaching me to shoot. He&#8217;s home now, you
know, and comes over most days, and when Patricia
won&#8217;t play golf, he takes me shooting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Patricia&#8217;s taken to golf then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Geoffry says she&#8217;s splendid, but I expect
that&#8217;s just to make her play up.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had turned off the highroad now and were in
the fields following a path on the side of the sloping
meadows. The mist that hung over the river did not
reach up to them and Christopher could see the thick
foliage of the woods opposite, splashed with gold and
russet, heavy with moisture. The warm damp smell
of autumn was in the air. He took a long breath and
squared his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good to be back. To think of its being four
whole years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And two since you&#8217;ve seen any of us. Are you
going away again, Christopher?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;In the spring. There&#8217;s St. Michael.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was waiting by a stile leading into a wood that
gave quicker access to Marden Court, and he came
forward to meet them with undisguised pleasure.</p>
<p>Charles Aston had rendered but small homage to
time. He was as erect and thin as ever, hair perhaps
a little white, but the kind eyes had lost nothing
of their penetrating quality.</p>
<p>Christopher&#8217;s welcome could not have been warmer
had it been his own father. Max went ahead to find
Charlotte and left the two to come on together.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is C&aelig;sar?&#8221; demanded Christopher, the moment
they were alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you wait for his own report?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want yours.&#8221; There was an urgent insistence in
his voice, and Mr. Aston looked at him sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he is decidedly better since he came down
here, and I want him to stay, Christopher, to give up
London in the end perhaps altogether.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has not been well then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not thought so: but what made you suspicious,
my dear boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His letters have been over-witty and deliberately
satirical. Just the sort of things he says when something
is wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Aston nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I felt that. There seemed nothing physically
wrong, but I felt he must have more people round
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I stay here too, and go up and down when
needs must.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the Colonial Commission? How will it get
on without you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they easily found a better man. As I explained
to C&aelig;sar, I was only asked as a compliment,&#8221;
he answered simply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>Christopher kept to himself his dissent from this,
and was silent a moment, thinking how this man&#8217;s life
was spent to one end; and desirable as he felt that end
to be, he was of age now to feel a tinge of regret for
all that had been and still was sacrificed to it. An infinitesimal
sacrifice of personal feeling and convenience
was demanded of him now, if he were to second St.
Michael&#8217;s attempt to keep Aymer from Aston House
and teach him to permanently regard Marden Court
as home, for dearly as Christopher loved Marden it
was only there he was awake to the apparently indisputable
truth that he was not one of that dear family
who had done their best to make him forget once and
for all that obnoxious fact. His sense of proprietorship
in Aymer and of Aymer&#8217;s in him was undeniably
stronger in town than in the country, and this not entirely
because Nevil was to all intents master of Marden,
but rather that there Aymer himself was less isolated,
merged more into the general family life, and
became again part of the usages and traditions of his
own race.</p>
<p>Mr. Aston, without actually speaking the words, had
conveyed to Christopher his own dread lest some day
Aymer might be left alone, stranded mentally and
physically in the great silent London house that was
their home by force of dear companionship. Christopher
saw it in a flash, saw it so clearly that he involuntarily
glanced at his companion to assure himself of
the remoteness of that dread chance. Hard on this
thought pressed the knowledge that neither of these
two men who had done so much for him made the
least claim on his life or asked ought of him but success
in his chosen line&mdash;and that knowledge was both
sweet and bitter to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;C&aelig;sar will be far better satisfied when you are actually
started at work,&#8221; Mr. Aston went on. &#8220;He
lives in your future, Christopher, he is more impatient
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
for this training period to be over than you yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I am training and have no time to think.
The first real step is coming. I have a good chance,
only I must tell him first.&#8221;</p>
<p>He quickened his steps insensibly, for the thought
of C&aelig;sar waiting was like a spur even to physical effort,
and even so his mind outraced his feet, till it
came full tilt against a girl coming directly from its
goal and momentarily obliterating it by her very
presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Christopher, Christopher,&#8221; Patricia cried,
holding out both hands. &#8220;How long you have been!
I began to think you never would come again!&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher, taking her hands, felt it was a long two
years since they parted and that time had made fair
road here meanwhile. His thoughts outpaced his feet
no longer, but kept decent step with the light footfall
beside him.</p>
<p>Mr. Aston, following, noted it all, and first smiled
and then sighed a little. The smile was for them and
the little sigh for Aymer waiting within.</p>
<p>He found, however, little reason to repeat his sigh
during the next few weeks, for Christopher was in
constant attendance on Aymer, and gave but the residue
of his time to the rest of the little world. His
suspicions as to Aymer&#8217;s well-being vanished away, for
the latter betrayed by no outward sign the sleepless
nights and long days spent in wrestling with intangible
dread of impending evil and the return of almost
forgotten black hours. Indeed, Christopher&#8217;s steady
dependable strength and vigorous energy seemed to
renew belief and confidence in the man with whom
life had broken faith. He was jealously greedy of
Christopher&#8217;s company, though he sought to hide this
under a mask of indifference, and he made a deliberate
attempt to keep him near him by the exercise of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
every personal and social gift he possessed. It was
not enough for him to hold his adopted son&#8217;s affection
by the bond of the past, it was not enough to be
loved by force of custom, his present individuality
struggled for recognition and won it. Deliberately,
skilfully and successfully he bound Christopher to
him by force of personality, by reason of being what
he was as apart from all he had done.</p>
<p>None of the household grudged him his triumph or
resented their own dismissal from attendance in the
West Room. The women-kind once more superfluous
to C&aelig;sar&#8217;s well-being, resumed their wonted routine
with generous content.</p>
<p>Patricia&#8217;s routine appeared to consist very largely
of golf in which she and Geoffry Leverson could undoubtedly
give Christopher long odds. Christopher,
however, was undaunted, and the few hours he did
not spend in Aymer&#8217;s company, he spent toiling round
the links points behind Patricia, play she never so
badly. Geoffry complained bitterly to Patricia in private
that she was spoiling her game, but she, indifferent
to her handicap, continued to play with Christopher
and to ignore promised matches with Geoffry
whenever her old playmate chose to set foot on the
green.</p>
<p>At length Geoffry could stand it no longer and protested
loudly when Christopher challenged her, that
it was the third time she had put off a return match.
Christopher withdrew his challenge at once and declared
he would infinitely rather watch a match. Patricia
demurred and pouted, whereupon he sternly insisted
that promises must be kept.</p>
<p>She played Geoffry and beat him by one point, secured
by a rather vicious putt, then lightly requesting
him to take her clubs back to the Club House with
his, she summoned Christopher to take her home.
Geoffry had not protested again. He took early opportunity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
to challenge Christopher instead and reaped
a small revenge of easy victories, half embittered,
half enhanced by Patricia&#8217;s plainly expressed annoyance
with the vanquished one. He knew she would
have condoled with him had he lost.</p>
<p>So the weeks slipped by unnoticed and autumn
merged into winter. Christmas came and went&mdash;with
festivities in which both Patricia and Christopher took
active part.</p>
<p>Christopher read and studied, but did nothing definite,
and the New Year slipped along with rapid, silent
foot. It was C&aelig;sar who at length broke up the pleasant
drifting interlude and he did it as deliberately as
he did everything else, urged by his haunting desire
to see Christopher finally committed to the future he
had chosen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go and see those road experiments
they are trying in Kent?&#8221; Aymer asked one day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frost-proof roads? They are no good. It was
tried in Germany. What I would like is to run down
to Cornwall and see how the Atlantic Road stands the
winter, only it&#8217;s such a beastly way down by train.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would certainly interfere with golf?&#8221; returned
C&aelig;sar drily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to play. Leverson says if I work
really hard I may do something in a few years. Patricia
says I shan&#8217;t even if I live to be as old as Methuselah;
so I must stick to it to prove her wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s highly desirable, of course. All the same
she might leave you a little leisure to play round with
your hobby. You mustn&#8217;t work too hard or Sam will
beat you yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is Sam?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He came to see me before I left town. He is doing
well. They will take him in as junior partner in
a year or two. I always said he&#8217;d do better than you.&#8221;
He sighed profoundly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What a pity you didn&#8217;t adopt him instead of me,&#8221;
retorted Christopher teasingly. &#8220;Is it too late to exchange?
Buy him a senior partnership and leave me
a free lance.&#8221;</p>
<p>And because Aymer did not reply at once to his
familiar nonsense, he turned quickly and surprised a
strange look in the blue eyes, a fleeting, shadowy love,
passionate, fierce, jealous. It lost itself almost as he
caught it and Aymer drawled out in his indifferent
tone:</p>
<p>&#8220;It really might be worth considering. For then
I could go back to London and he could come home
every night. Besides, Sam really appreciates me.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it was Christopher who had no answer ready
this time.</p>
<p>The look he had surprised gripped his heart. It
revealed something hitherto unguessed by him. He
came and sat on the edge of the sofa, and though he
spoke lightly as was his manner, his voice and eyes
belied his words.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, Sam does not appreciate you at
all. He regards you as an erratic philanthropist with
a crank for assisting deserving boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A just estimate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all. It is wrong in every particular.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Prove it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not erratic; you are methodical to a fault.
You are not a crank; therefore not a philanthropist.
And you show a lamentable disregard to the moral
qualities of those to whom you extend a helping hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jealousy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jealousy of whom, please?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of Sam.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher considered thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you are right,&#8221; he returned at last in a
tone of na&iuml;ve surprise. &#8220;How stupid of me not to
have guessed before. I had always tried to think you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
helped him to gratify me. It was a great strain on
my credulity. Now I understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It had nothing to do with you at all,&#8221; retorted
C&aelig;sar irritably, shifting his position a little, whereby
a cushion fell to the ground. With a gust of petulance
he pitched another after it, and then in rather a shamed
way, told Christopher to ring for Vespasian to put
the confounded things right.</p>
<p>But Christopher did no such thing. He put his
strong arm round C&aelig;sar, raised him, and rearranged
the refractory cushions, talking the while to divert attention
from this unheard-of proceeding.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall go to London to-morrow and study Sam
in order to oust him from your fickle affections,&#8221; he
announced. &#8220;Seriously, C&aelig;sar. I ought to be running
round seeing things a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>And C&aelig;sar, having brought him to the conclusion
he wished, signified his entire approval.</p>
<p>The following morning when Christopher came in
to bid C&aelig;sar good-bye, he found Mr. Aston also there,
standing by the fire with a humorous smile on his face
in evident appreciation of some joke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christopher,&#8221; said Aymer severely, &#8220;I have
something important to say to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher drew himself up to attention as he had
learnt to do when under rebuke as a boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are going to make a habit of running up
and down to town and the ends of the earth on ridiculous
business and worrying everyone&#8217;s life out with
time-tables (it was notorious Christopher never consulted
anyone about his comings and goings), you
must understand you cannot use Renata&#8217;s carriage and
pair for your station work. Max&#8217;s pony is not up to
your weight, neither is the station fly. I find on inquiry
my father occasionally requires his motor for his
own use; anyhow, it is not supposed to get muddy. So
you had better buy one for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>He held out a blank signed cheque.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>Christopher looked from one to the other. It was
the dream of his life to possess a motor, but this free
gift of one was overwhelming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; went on C&aelig;sar hastily, &#8220;I shan&#8217;t give
you a birthday present too. It&#8217;s to get out of that, you
understand. You are twenty-one, aren&#8217;t you? And
it&#8217;s only half mine, the other half is from St. Michael.
I don&#8217;t know where your manners are, Christopher;
I thought I had brought you up to be polite. Go and
thank the gentleman nicely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher turned to Mr. Aston, but he was beyond
words. He could only look his overwhelming gratitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not I,&#8221; said that gentleman, hastily. &#8220;I only
told C&aelig;sar I&#8217;d like to go shares&mdash;the lamps or bells or
something. Get a good horn with a good rich tone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher took the cheque with shaking fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t thank you, C&aelig;sar, it&#8217;s too big. Why didn&#8217;t
you let me earn it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to prove to you the justice of Sam&#8217;s
opinion of me. Hurry up; you&#8217;ll miss your train if
there is one at this hour at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve not filled up the cheque.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I. From what I know of your business
methods you&#8217;ll get what you want at half the price I
should. I&#8217;m not going to let St. Michael fling away
good money.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his excitement Christopher forgot to wait for
Patricia, who had promised to walk to the station with
him. (C&aelig;sar&#8217;s complaint anent the horse vehicles
was even more unfounded than his grievance over the
time-table.) But seeing him start, she ran after him
and made some candid and sisterly remarks on his behaviour
and was only mollified by a full explanation
of his unwonted state of elation. The rest of the walk
was spent in discussing the merits of various species
of motors.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>
<p>Christopher spent the whole of the day inspecting
possible motors, perfectly aware all the time of the
one he meant to purchase, but in no wise prepared to
forego the pleasures of inspection. Sam was not free
that evening, so he dined with Constantia Wyatt,
whose elusive personality continued to remove her in
his eyes far from relationship with ordinary women.
She was going to a &#8220;first night&#8221; at His Majesty&#8217;s
Theatre as a preliminary to her evening&#8217;s amusement,
and her husband, honestly engrossed in work, seized
on Christopher at once as an adequate substitute for
his own personal escort. He would meet her with the
carriage after and go with her to the Duchess of
Z&#8211;&#8211;, but it would be a great help to him to have
a few early evening hours for his book; so he explained
with elaborate care.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basil is so deliciously medi&aelig;val and quaint,&#8221; Constantia
confided to her young cavalier as the carriage
drove off; &#8220;he quite seriously believes women cannot
go to a theatre or anywhere without an escort, even in
our enlightened age. I assure you it is quite remarkable
the number of parties we attend together; people
are beginning to talk about it. If it&#8217;s impossible for
him to come himself he always seems to have hosts
of cousins or relations ready to take his place. Oh,
charming people; but quite a family corps, a sort of
&#8216;Guard of Honour,&#8217; as if I were Royalty&mdash;and really,
at my time of life.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned her radiantly beautiful face to Christopher.
She was indeed one of those beloved of time and
it seemed to Christopher as he saw her in the crude
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
flashing glare from the streets without, that the past
ten years which had made of him a man had left her
a girl still, but since he was as yet no adept at pretty
speeches he kept the thought to himself and said shyly:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not a question of age at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You, too, think me incompetent to look after myself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not a matter of competence either, is it? I
mean, one can easily understand that Mr. Wyatt is
proud of being your....&#8221; He stopped lamely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finish your sentence, you tantalising boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your caretaker, then,&#8221; he concluded defiantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Delicious,&#8221; she clapped her hands softly. &#8220;I
thought you were going to say &#8216;proprietor.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is you who are the proprietor of the caretaker,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The new cadet is worthy his commission,&#8221; she
pronounced with mock gravity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a great honour, especially since I am not one
of the family.&#8221;</p>
<p>He never forgot this in her presence. It was as if
an overscrupulous remembrance of hard days forced
him to disclaim kinship with anything so finely feminine
as Constantia Wyatt; as if he found no right of
way from his own world of concrete fact into that
delicate gracious world of illusions in which he placed
her. Such barriers did not exist for her, however,
and thence it came that it was to Constantia that Christopher
spoke most easily of his relationship to the
Aston family.</p>
<p>She put aside his disclaimer now, almost indignantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You belong to Aymer. How can you say you do
not belong to us, when you have been so good for
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>His main claim on them all lay in that, that he was
and had been good <i>for</i> the idolised Aymer Aston. He
recognised it as she spoke and was content, for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
proud generosity of his nature was built on a humility
that had no underprops of petty pride.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was quite unpremeditated on my part,&#8221; he
protested whimsically; &#8220;you are all far too good to
me. I can never explain it to myself, but I accept it,
and realise I am a real millionaire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Constantia Wyatt started slightly. Christopher
noticed the diamonds on her hair sparkle as she leant
forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you discover that?&#8221; she asked in a low
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;My fortune? I was only ten when I came to
C&aelig;sar, but I must have been a very dense child indeed
if I had not known even then that the luck of the gods
was mine&mdash;if I had not been sensible of the kindness&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice was low also and he fell into his old bad
habit of leaving his sentence unfinished&mdash;hardly knowing
he had expressed so much.</p>
<p>Constantia gave a sigh of relief, and Christopher
again was only aware of the twinkling diamonds, of
melting lines of soft velvet and fur, a presence friendly
but unanalysable. They passed at that moment a
mansion of a prince of the world of money, and she
indicated it with a wave of her fan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Supposing, Christopher, you could realise some
of your imaginary fortune for <i>his</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heaven forbid. Think how it was made.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The world forgets that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not forget,&#8221; he answered quickly; &#8220;besides
it&#8217;s much nicer to be adopted than to fight other
people for fortune.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought all boys liked fighting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if there&#8217;s anything better to be done. A
Punch and Judy show or a funeral will stop the most
violent set-to. I&#8217;ve seen it times, when I was a boy in
the street. Sam and I raised a cry one day of &#8216;soldiers&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
to stop a chum being knocked down. Then we
ran.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh. Christopher, Christopher, can&#8217;t you forget
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to. It wouldn&#8217;t be fair to C&aelig;sar.
Also I couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some day you will marry, and perhaps she will
rather you should forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, she won&#8217;t, she is far too fond of C&aelig;sar.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped abruptly. For one brief moment the
great voice of the streets and the yellow glare died
away; he was blinded by a bewildering white light that
broke down barriers undreamed of within his soul.
Then the actual comparative darkness of the carriage
obscured it and he found himself again conscious of
the scent of roses, the sheen of satin and soft velvet,
and his heart was beating madly. He had stumbled
over the unsuspected threshold, surprised the hidden
temple of his own heart, and this, inopportunely, prematurely,
and, to his everlasting confusion, in the
presence of another.</p>
<p>He clanged to the gates of his inner consciousness
in breathless haste and set curb on his momentary
shame and amazement. The break was so short his
companion had barely time to identify the image disclosed
when his voice went on with quiet deliberation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or will be when she appears. A case of &#8216;if she
be not fair to &#8220;he,&#8221; what care I how fair she be.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Constantia with rare generosity offered no hindrance
to the closing of the door and discreetly pretended
she had not been aware it had opened. Yet
she smiled to herself and decided it was quite a desirable
image and very advantageous to Aymer. Also,
she reflected with pleasure, she had predicted the result
from Patricia&#8217;s and Christopher&#8217;s intimacy, to her
father years ago.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>The piece at the theatre was a modern comedy which
did not greatly interest him, indeed, he was more concerned
in keeping his attention from that newly-discovered
temple within than in unravelling the mysteries
of the rather thread-bare plot of the play. Being,
however, quite unaccustomed to dealing with this dual
condition of mind it is to be feared he was a little &#8220;distrait&#8221;
and mechanical of speech. Constantia allowed
him the first act to play out his mood and then with
charming imperiousness claimed his full attention,
gained it, and with it, his gratitude for timely distraction.</p>
<p>Half way through the play he remembered this was
the theatre at which Mrs. Sartin and Jessie were employed.
He mentioned the fact to Mrs. Wyatt, who
remarked gravely their names were not on the programme.
Christopher equally gravely explained quite
briefly. If he found nothing surprising in his own
interest in these friends of the past, he never made
the error of imagining they would be of interest to
newer friends. There was a certain independence in
his attitude towards all affairs that touched him
nearly, which even at this early age made him a free
citizen of the world in which he chanced to move. This
attitude of mind was more in evidence to-night than
he had imagined. Personally, he quite appreciated the
fact he was sitting in a box with one of the loveliest
women in London, and that she was everything that
was charming and nice to him, but it never occurred
to him that half the men in the theatre would have
given a big share of their worth to be in his place;
he was almost childishly unconscious of the envious
glances he earned. Constantia was not: neither was
she blind to his attitude of personal content and impersonal
oblivion. It amused her vastly, and she compiled
an exceedingly entertaining letter to Aymer on
the strength of it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He handed me over to Basil in the vestibule afterwards,&#8221;
she concluded, &#8220;with the most engaging air
of having been allowed a special treat and fully appreciating
it, and departed straightway to conduct
Mrs. Sartin, dresser at the theatre, to her house in the
wilds of Lambeth. He owned it in the most ingenuous
way, seeing nothing whatever of pathos in it.
Does he lack sense of humour?&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer, ignoring the rest of the letter, refuted this
query with pages of vigorous sarcasm, to the complete
delight and triumph of his sister.</p>
<p>Christopher, having ascertained from a suspicious
doorkeeper that Mrs. Sartin would not be free for
twenty minutes, cooled his heels in a dark, draughty
passage with what patience he could.</p>
<p>He seized on Mrs. Sartin as she came unsuspectingly
down a winding stair, and bore her off breathless,
remonstrating, but fluttering with pride, in a hansom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m only up for a few days,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Sam
dines with me to-morrow and I want you to come out
somewhere in the afternoon. Crystal Palace, or
wherever Jessie likes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sartin&#8217;s face and Mrs. Sartin&#8217;s person had expanded
in the last few years and her powers of expressing
emotion seemed to have expanded with her
person. Disappointment was writ large on her ample
countenance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, if that isn&#8217;t a shame and a contrariwise
of purpose. I&#8217;ve taken a job, Mr. Christopher,
for that blessed afternoon. I&#8217;ve promised to dress
Miss Asty, who is making a deb&ucirc;t at a matiny at the
Court. Eliza Lowden, she was goin&#8217; to dress her, but
she can&#8217;t set a wig as I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a nuisance. But, anyhow, Jessie isn&#8217;t engaged,
is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>For an instant he had a glimpse of Mrs. Sartin&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
full face, dubious, questioning, even hostile, but to
him it was merely the result of flickering light and
conveyed nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t rightly know,&#8221; she said slowly, &#8220;maybe
she doesn&#8217;t care much for gadding about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rubbish,&#8221; he retorted contemptuously, &#8220;if you
can&#8217;t come, Jessie must anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sartin held firmly to the carriage door and the
oscillation of the cab caused her to nod violently, but
it was not in assent to Christopher&#8217;s proposition. She
appeared to be turning something over in her slow
mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know but what I could arrange with
Eliza,&#8221; she remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you can, like a good woman; and you
and Jessie come up to Aston House at one o&#8217;clock and
say where you&#8217;d like to go, and we&#8217;ll go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martha demurred. &#8220;Mr. Aston won&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t like what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our comin&#8217; to &#8217;is &#8217;ouse, like as if we &#8217;ad any claim
on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I or you know Mr. Aston best?&#8221; he demanded
imperiously. &#8220;Claim indeed. Martha, you dear old
stupid, where would I be now, if you hadn&#8217;t taken my
mother in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That were just a chance, Mr. Christopher, because
I &#8217;appened to be comin&#8217; &#8217;ome late and your pore ma
was took bad on the bridge as I crossed, and bein&#8217; a
woman what &#8217;ad a family, I saw what was the
matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was it more than a chance that C&aelig;sar in
looking for a boy to adopt stumbled on the son of
someone he used to know?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the oscillation made Mrs. Sartin nod vigorously.
She bestowed on her companion another of
those shrewd, dubious glances, began a sentence and
stopped.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. What were you saying?&#8221; asked Christopher
absently.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve come quite far enough, Mr. Christopher,&#8221;
she announced, with the air of a woman come to a
decision, &#8220;you just tell that man on the top to stop
and let me out. Thanking you all the same, but I
don&#8217;t care to be seen driving &#8217;ome this time of night
and settin&#8217; folks a-talking. You set me down, there&#8217;s
a dear Mr. Christopher.&#8221;</p>
<p>She got her way in the matter of dismissing the cab,
but not in dismissing Christopher, her primary desire,
lest an indiscreet tongue should prompt her to say more
than was &#8220;rightful,&#8221; as she explained to Jessie.</p>
<p>&#8220;For if the dear innocent don&#8217;t see &#8217;ow the land
lays, it isn&#8217;t for me to show &#8217;im, and Mr. Aymer so
good to Sam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you are all wrong,&#8221; said Jessie shortly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sartin sniffed contemptuously.</p>
<p>The Sartins no longer inhabited Primrose Buildings,
but were proud inhabitants of a decent little
house in a phenomenally dull street, sufficiently near
the big &#8220;Store&#8221; to suit Sam&#8217;s convenience. Sam
himself came to the door and, late as it was, insisted
on walking back with Christopher into the region of
cabs, and, becoming engrossed in conversation, naturally
walked far beyond it.</p>
<p>&#8220;This partnership business,&#8221; began Sam at once,
&#8220;I do wish, Chris, you&#8217;d get Mr. Aymer to make it a
loan business. I&#8217;d be a sight better pleased.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t for the life of me see why,&#8221; Christopher
objected with a frown. &#8220;It&#8217;s only a matter of a few
hundred pounds, and if C&aelig;sar chooses to spend it on
you instead of buying a picture or enamel, or that sort
of toy, why should you object. It&#8217;s not charity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what is it?&#8221; demanded Sam, &#8220;because I&#8217;m
not a toy. Don&#8217;t fly out at me, Chris, be reasonable.
I&#8217;m as grateful to him as I can be, and I mean to use
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
the chance he&#8217;s given me all I can. But this partnership
business beats me. It&#8217;s all very well for him to
do things for you. Of course he couldn&#8217;t do less; but
how do I come in?&#8221;</p>
<p>A drunken man reeled out of a house and lurched
against Christopher, who put out his hand to steady
him without a word of comment, and when the drinker
had found his balance, he turned again to Sam with
sharp indignation.</p>
<p>&#8220;He could do a jolly sight less for me and still be
more generous than most people&#8217;s fathers. There&#8217;s no
&#8216;of course&#8217; about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam stared stolidly in front of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it. It&#8217;s one thing to do it for someone
belonging to one, and another thing to do it for a
stranger,&#8221; he persisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s just how I feel, only I don&#8217;t make a
fuss. It&#8217;s C&aelig;sar&#8217;s way, and a precious good way for
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>They parted at last with no better understanding
on the vexed subject, and Christopher, once back at
Aston House, sat frowning over the fire instead of going
to bed. Why all of a sudden had this question of
his amazing indebtedness to Aymer been so persistently
thrust on him. Hitherto he had accepted it with
generous gratitude, without question, had recognised
no room for speculation, allowed no play to whispers
of curiosity. It was C&aelig;sar&#8217;s will. Now he was suddenly
aware, however he might close his mind, others
speculated; however guard his soul from inquisitiveness,
others questioned, and it angered him for
C&aelig;sar&#8217;s sake. His mother had never spoken to him
of the past, never opened her lips as to the strange
sacrifice she had made for her unborn child, except
once when they were hurriedly leaving London by
stealth, after the episode with Martha Sartin&#8217;s rascally
husband. Mrs. Hibbault had remarked wearily: &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
wonder, Jim, shall I spend my life taking you out of
the way of bad men?&#8221;</p>
<p>When he asked her if she had done it before she
answered: &#8220;I took you from your father.&#8221; It was
the only time he remembered her mentioning that unknown
father; he recollected still how her face had
changed and she had hurried her steps, as if haunted
by a new suspicion.</p>
<p>It gave him quite unreasonable annoyance that these
thoughts intruded themselves to-night, when he
wanted to give his full attention to the wonder and
glory of the discovery he had made in Constantia
Wyatt&#8217;s company. That was, indeed, a matter of real
moment. How had he contrived to be blind to it so
long? He had not reached the age of twenty-one without
entertaining vague theories concerning love, and
having definitely decided that it had nothing to do
with the travesty of its name which had confronted
him on his wanderings. Neither taste nor training,
nor the absorbing passion for his work had left him
time or wish to explore this field which roused only an
impatient contempt when thrust on his notice. Of
Love itself, as before stated, he held vague theories:
regarding it rather as a far-off event which would
meet him in future years and land him eventually at
Hymen&#8217;s feet. And here he found all such theories
suddenly reversed. The first moment the idea of marriage
was presented to his notice the vision of the only
possible bride for him stood out with quite definite
distinctness. Instead of Love being a prelude to the
thought of Marriage, that thought had been the crashing
chords that had opened his mind to Love. But
the Love had been already there, unrecognised. He
found he could no way now imagine himself as apart
from Patricia. To eliminate her presence from his
heart was to lose part of his individuality; to separate
his practical life from her was as if he wantonly destroyed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
a limb. Away from her actual presence and
before this dual conception of themselves he was of
assured courage, thankfulness and strange joy, but the
moment his thoughts flew to her in concrete form, to
Patricia Connell at Marden Court, he experienced a
reversion: his confidence was gone, the assured vision
became a very far-away possibility, a glory which he
might hardly hope to attain.</p>
<p>Very slowly this latter aspect blotted out the first
triumphant joy of his discovery. Mundane things,
such as Renata Aston&#8217;s wishes, C&aelig;sar&#8217;s consent, and
even the person of Geoffry Leverson interposed between
Patricia and him. This mood had its sway and
in turn succumbed to an awakening of his dormant
will and every fighting instinct. Patricia must be his,
was his potentially, but he recognised she was not his
for the asking. He would have to acquire the right to
say to C&aelig;sar, &#8220;I want to marry Mrs. Aston&#8217;s sister.&#8221;
Aymer might easily make the way smooth for him, if
he would. He had no reason then for believing he
would oppose the idea. Yet Christopher knew that in
the gamut of possible needs and desires the one thing
he could not freely accept from C&aelig;sar&#8217;s hands was
his wife. His life was before him, before Patricia
too. When he reached this point in his deliberation
he made a sudden movement. The fire had gone out
and it was very cold. Christopher decided it was time
to go to bed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>
<p>Jessie proved by no means averse to &#8220;gadding
about,&#8221; as her mother expressed it. She and Mrs. Sartin
turned up punctually at Aston House, though
laden with an air of desperate resolve. On their way
they had both cheerfully concealed some tremulous
qualms and neither had ventured to express a dormant
wish that Mr. Christopher had chosen some other spot
for lunch than the lordly, sombre, half-opened house.
It was not until they stood beneath the great portico
that their vague discomfort got the upper hand, and
Mrs. Sartin agreed without demur to Jessie&#8217;s suggestion
that they should seek a smaller entrance. As they
were turning away the great door swung open and
Christopher came out.</p>
<p>&#8220;How jolly of you to be so punctual,&#8221; he cried,
greeting them warmly. &#8220;Where were you off to?
Did you think I wasn&#8217;t at home because the blinds
were down? They don&#8217;t open all the house for me,&#8221;
he added, leading the way through the great hall. &#8220;I
live on the garden side.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sartin had no mind to hurry: she wanted to
take in the solid beauties as she passed. Jessie plucked
her nervously by the sleeve seeing Christopher was
outpacing them, and terrified of being left in that
labyrinth of corridor without a guide. However, once
within the sunny little room with its homely comforts
and Christopher&#8217;s kindly self for host, they regained
their wonted composure.</p>
<p>The smallness of the staff left in charge at Aston
House gave Christopher an excuse for dispensing with
the services of Burton, the footman, and the meal was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
a great success. It never occurred to the host to think
these good kind friends of his in any way out of place
here. His sense of humour was quite unruffled, nay,
he was even genuinely pleased to see the good, ample
Martha, the strings of her black bonnet untied, her
face wreathed in smiles, vigorously clearing out a
tart dish, and Jessie&#8217;s homely features lit up with passive
enjoyment, her brown eyes shining beneath the
ridiculous curls.</p>
<p>They had chosen the Hippodrome for their afternoon&#8217;s
amusement, and there was plenty of time after
lunch to show them some of the glories of Aston
House. Christopher led them through the shrouded
rooms, but the treasures he displayed to view were
not so much those of artistic merit as those which had
pleased his own boyish fancy years before. Passing
down a corridor he stopped by a remote closed door.
Jessie was examining some Wedgewood plaques a
little way off. Christopher looked at Mrs. Sartin with
a queer little smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was a kid,&#8221; he said rather shamefacedly,
&#8220;I used to play that my mother was going about the
place with me. You see there were no women-folk,
and the pretence seemed to help things. I used to
make it seem more real by always starting here, and
pretending that was her room. It was the only door
that was always locked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lor&#8217;, what a queer idea!&#8221; ejaculated Mrs. Sartin,
gazing suspiciously at the closed door.</p>
<p>Christopher laughed. &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve been in since;
there&#8217;s nothing there but newspapers, quite a dull little
room. But it was an odd fancy. My feeling was so
strong I used to take her round and show her things
I&#8217;ve shown you to-day. I always wanted to show them
to someone instead of the real treasures, which are
rather dull, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sartin said again it was very queer. She followed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
Jessie and Christopher reluctantly with backward
glances towards the door, full of puzzled suspicion.
When they were again in the hall it was time
to start for the Hippodrome, and there was a great
deal of patting of hats and tying of strings before a
Venetian mirror.</p>
<p>But Aymer Aston&#8217;s room, with its world-famed
pictures, was unvisited.</p>
<p>When the Hippodrome performance was over and
he had seen his guests safely homeward, Christopher
called on Constantia Wyatt and found her in. She
seemed in no wise surprised to see him, but asked him
promptly when he was going down to Marden.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he said slowly, his eyes on the fire,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I shall go back yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Constantia rang the bell and told the footman she
was not at home, and then drew her chair up to the
fire and made Christopher some fresh tea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is London proving so very attractive?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t stay in town. I think I shall go abroad
again. I want to think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear, dear. Is Marden such a bad atmosphere
for the intelligence?&#8221;</p>
<p>He coloured up boy-like and then laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are too many clever people to help one
think there. Also there is a man in Belgium trying
some private road experiments. I want to help him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What will Aymer say to it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He thinks I&#8217;ve been idle long enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the man in Belgium will help you to think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that&#8217;s my own job.&#8221;</p>
<p>Constantia rose and wandered round the room,
vaguely touching a flower here and there and presently
came to stand behind her visitor&#8217;s chair. She was
thinking how young he was, and how strong, and that
Patricia was a fortunate girl. Her eyes were very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
soft and kind as she bent over his chair and touched
his shoulder with her fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christopher, you are in love!&#8221;</p>
<p>Very young indeed, was her inward comment on his
startled wondering face turned to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; he asked, making no denial
of the fact. Denial would have savoured of disloyalty
to his new kingdom.</p>
<p>She laughed gently. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you even know that?
What a lot I could teach you if Aymer would hand
you over. Listen, Master Christopher, love is the only
thing men want to think about alone, just as it&#8217;s the
only thing a woman never wants to keep to herself.
You could think to much better advantage at Marden
but it&#8217;s no use telling you so. You won&#8217;t believe
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do believe it, only it&#8217;s not a question of <i>my</i> advantage,
you see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There spoke Aymer&#8217;s pupil. Remember roads
take a good deal of making and short cuts were made
for&mdash;lovers.&#8221;</p>
<p>She returned to the fire and stood there looking at
him with an interest that surprised herself: a tall,
gracious presence whose knowledge of his secret hurt
not one bit, so clearly did it lie within the realms
wherein all gracious, tender women reign.</p>
<p>Then she changed the subject quite abruptly, thrust
it back into those hazy regions of speculation from
which Christopher had so hardly and impatiently
dragged it the previous night.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if your mother were alive, if she would
be satisfied with you, Christopher, and if she would
still want to make a socialist of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother?&#8221; he echoed dully.</p>
<p>For a while he struggled with a strange inability to
lay hold on the shadowy form he knew so well. He
looked round the beautiful room that was but a setting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
to a lovely woman and then back at her. Why had
she spoken of his mother? He again attempted to
crystallise the thought of the dearly loved, defeated
woman in the presence of her to whom the world denied
nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do it,&#8221; he said aloud with a quick breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do what?&#8221; she queried swiftly, but got no answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was my mother a socialist?&#8221; he asked presently
with difficulty.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I have always understood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who told you so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father. I thought you knew that, Christopher,
or I should not have mentioned it. All I know
is, she chose to be poor rather than expose you to the
dangers of wealth. I know nothing else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher stood up. &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I
believe I did know that, but I have never been reminded
of it. I do not know her story: I suppose she
did not wish me to know it, but I do know whatever
she chose, whatever she did, it was chosen and done
because it seemed to her the right course and therefore
the only one she could take.&#8221;</p>
<p>Constantia nodded, still gazing at the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aymer&#8217;s training on the top of that,&#8221; she mused,
&#8220;I suppose you are accounted for.&#8221;</p>
<p>He grew red and looked a boy again. &#8220;I should
have much to account for if I failed them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Them?&#8221; She swung round.</p>
<p>&#8220;C&aelig;sar and my mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so you will go to Belgium and think?&#8221; she
said lightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I shall go to Belgium and work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said <i>think</i>,&#8221; she insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have thought here. I was not sure when I came,
but I am now.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>&#8220;May I know what you have thought?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment the strangeness of speaking to her
like this held him dumb. How did it happen she
should know so much and must know more, she who
had been barely a real individual to him before? It
bewildered and confused him. He did not understand
that the unspoken passionate claim he made on one
woman had broken the barriers between him and
woman-kind, that because he loved Patricia Connell
he could speak to Constantia Wyatt, for they stood
together on holy ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have every right. You helped me after all,&#8221;
he said doubtfully, but smiling &#8220;I ought not to have
hesitated. C&aelig;sar is waiting for me to make roads,
not to take short cuts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think love can better afford to wait than
C&aelig;sar?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have my life before me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you lose her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is settled,&#8221; he said simply.</p>
<p>She drew in her breath. By every law of man he
was right, and yet all the woman in her cried out
against this decision as falseness to some other law
imperfectly understood, but clamorous for recognition.
Nevertheless how her heart went out to him
for the quiet finality of that refusal to yield to a law
not of his own making! She was proud he was so
much the handiwork of Aymer, while she recognised
the very weakness of his strength.</p>
<p>&#8220;He will lose her,&#8221; she mused as she sat alone when
he had gone, &#8220;and it would break Aymer&#8217;s heart if
he knew, but he won&#8217;t know. He has succeeded in
making a man of him, but, oh, what a nice boy he
would have been!&#8221;</p>
<p>So Christopher turned his back on the great discovery
and went to Belgium. Whereupon Patricia
complained bitterly, but her golf improved, and Geoffry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
Leverson, who knew nothing of road-making,
started on a very short cut indeed.</p>
<p>The Roadmaker remained in Belgium longer than
he expected and in the laboratory of a great man
stumbled on the key of the discovery that in a few
years was to make him famous from one end of
Europe to the other.</p>
<p>When the apple blossoms were again blushing pink
across the land and the blue sky was piled high with
dreams of love castles, Christopher remembered the
short cut and abruptly announced his intention of returning
home. He sent no warning of his coming,
but arrived one day at Aston House with his beloved
car. It was in his heart to continue his journey
straight away, but thinking what pleasure it would
give Aymer to watch the practical working of his experiment,
he put aside the dictates of his desires and
spent the day purchasing materials. Also he called on
Constantia and found himself incomprehensibly making
excuses for the delay. &#8220;I shall go down early
to-morrow,&#8221; he said; &#8220;it can make no difference, since
they do not know I am in England.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t suppose it can,&#8221; said Constantia
thoughtfully.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>
<p>Christopher flecked an imaginary speck of dust from
the burnished metal of his car. He was all ready to
start, but seeing a postman coming up the drive,
waited to take down the latest delivery of letters, and
as he waited a hansom drove up, and since his car
occupied the portico, stopped at the side. A big form
emerged with a jovial red face and wide shoulders.
It was six years since Christopher had seen the man,
but his name and personality and, above all, the antipathy
with which he had formerly inspired him flashed
with lightning vividness to his mind. Peter Masters
glanced at Christopher with a momentary puzzled look
and turned to ring the bell.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to see Mr. Aston, Mr. Masters, he
is at Marden, and Aymer also. I&#8217;m just going down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah.&#8221; The keen eyes searched him up and down.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen you before; can&#8217;t place you, though; you
aren&#8217;t Nevil&#8217;s boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; Christopher hardly knew why he
changed the form of his answer, or that he had. &#8220;I&#8217;m
the boy Aymer adopted. You saw me about six years
ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I remember. Christopher Aston, they call
you. You did not like me. What have you done with
that clever head of yours, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher carefully examined a nut on the car.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, never mind. When will Cousin Charles
be back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not until May if he can help it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite well, thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter Masters stood biting his lip and considering.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
The footman brought out some letters which Christopher
put in his pocket and then mounted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I take any message for you?&#8221; he asked
politely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going straight to Marden now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher devoutly hoped he was, but a sudden
fear assailed him: he would not make the momentous
journey in solitude. He answered somewhat indistinctly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might run me down; I must see Cousin
Charles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should warn you it is a new road to me and
I&#8217;ve had my car nearly a year; it&#8217;s due to go wrong
somehow, and I drive rather fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect you set sufficient value on your own life
to insure mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be cold. You can&#8217;t ride in that thin coat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You pass the Carlton; I&#8217;m staying there. It
won&#8217;t delay us two minutes. What luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked round and got into the car, oblivious of
the trifling fact its owner had neither acquiesced nor
expressed an enthusiasm over the luck.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope he is nervous,&#8221; thought Christopher vindictively,
&#8220;though there&#8217;s not much chance of it. He
hasn&#8217;t much hair to stand on end, but I&#8217;ll do my best
to make it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter Masters rolled himself contentedly in the
spare rug. &#8220;Ready,&#8221; he said cheerfully.</p>
<p>Christopher, however, made no attempt to start. He
beckoned to the footman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fetch me the blue paper-covered book you&#8217;ll find
on the second left-hand shelf of the low book-case in
my room, Burton.&#8221;</p>
<p>He waited immovable while the man went on the
errand, being quite determined to start unprompted by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
Mr. Masters if he started at all. The old butler came
out and acknowledged Mr. Masters&#8217;s presence with
a deferential bow. He addressed himself to Christopher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Christopher, will you tell Mr. Aymer we&#8217;ve
raised the Raphael in his room, as he said, four inches,
but the paper is a little faded and it shows. What
will he like us to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher nodded. &#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll tell him. I
shall probably be up again next week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall be glad to see you again, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Burton returned in indecorous hurry with the book.
Christopher bade them good-bye in a friendly way and
the car glided quietly down the drive out into the busy
thoroughfare.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are quite at home there,&#8221; remarked Mr. Masters
affably.</p>
<p>&#8220;It happens to be my home.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a very busy hour and the driver of the car
might reasonably be excused if he were silent. At all
events if Mr. Masters spoke, Christopher did not hear
him. They slipped in and out of the traffic, glided
round corners, slid with smooth swiftness along free
stretches of road, crept gingerly across a maze of
cross-ways and drew up at the Carlton.</p>
<p>Peter Masters, who appreciated the situation and
found humour in it, plunged into that Palace of Travellers
and reappeared in an incredibly short time,
coated for the occasion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said cheerily, &#8220;we are ready for the
fray&mdash;when you are ready, Master Christopher,&#8221; he
added with a twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>But Christopher&#8217;s ill-temper had evaporated with
the short wait. After all, the man was Aymer&#8217;s cousin,
and he couldn&#8217;t help being a brute, and if he really
wanted to see St. Michael perhaps it was a piece of
luck for him that the postman was late. So he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
laughed and said a little shyly he hoped Mr. Masters
would not mind his not talking till they were out of
the streets.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall expect conversation with compound interest,&#8221;
returned the other good-humouredly.</p>
<p>He was, however, quite quiet until Christopher
turned into a narrow back street.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not your best way,&#8221; said Peter Masters
sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to call on a friend,&#8221; replied the driver
without apology.</p>
<p>They threaded their way through a maze of small
ill-looking streets, slowly enough, for there were children
all over the road; not infrequently a big dray
forced them to proceed backwards. Masters noted
that Christopher never expected the legitimate traffic
should give way to him. They emerged at last on a
crowded thoroughfare of South London, where small
shops elbowed big ones and windows blazed with preposterous
advertisements. There were trams too, and
scarcely room for the big car between rail and pavement.
Presently they stopped before a prosperous-looking
grocery store. A white-aproned man rushed
out with undisguised complacency to wait on the fine
equipage.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to see Mr. Sartin if he&#8217;s free,&#8221; said Christopher,
and waited quietly.</p>
<p>In a minute Sam was with them, white-aproned,
pencil behind ear. To Masters&#8217;s amusement his companion
greeted the young grocer with the familiarity
of long friendship.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard from Jessie the other day,&#8221; said Christopher
when he had explained his appearance; &#8220;what
about this man Cladsley? Is she going to marry
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam looked down the street, a little frown on his
face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Jessie&#8217;d no business to write you. Cladsley&#8217;s all
right. Don&#8217;t you worry about Jessie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not worrying,&#8221; laughed the other, &#8220;I only
wanted to be sure it was suitable and all that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll look after Jessie.&#8221; The words were ungracious,
but Sam looked worried and uncertain. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
done enough for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You old dog in the manger,&#8221; persisted Christopher
good-temperedly, &#8220;you&#8217;ll never let me do anything
for Jessie, and, after all, it was she who used to take
my part when you fought me, Master Sam, and
wouldn&#8217;t let you bully me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam grinned. &#8220;Yes, it was always Jim that was
in the right then. Don&#8217;t you bother. Cladsley&#8217;s a
good sort if she would only make up her mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I gathered his job would be up soon and I thought
I might find another for him if it&#8217;s all straight with
them. That&#8217;s why I came to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam appeared still reluctant.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all beastly stuck-up pride on your part,&#8221; concluded
Christopher after more argument. &#8220;I expect
you&#8217;ll cut me next; you are getting too prosperous,
Mr. Sartin.&#8221;</p>
<p>But they parted good friends, and the car re-threaded
its way through the crowded streets out into
a meaner, more deserted neighbourhood, till at length
they emerged on a long empty straight road with
small yellow brick houses on either side, as yet uninhabited.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the engaging young grocer&#8217;s name?&#8221;
asked Masters abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sartin&mdash;Sam Sartin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Known him long?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were children together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Relations, perhaps?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did he call you Jim?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I used to be Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;James Aston?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve forgotten,&#8221; said Christopher very deliberately.</p>
<p>Mr. Masters laughed genially. &#8220;I like a good liar.
You don&#8217;t want to tell me anything about yourself.
Very likely you are wise, but all the same I am very
curious to know all about you&mdash;who you are, and
how you came to the Astons, and who was your
mother, and when and where Aymer met her. You
see,&#8221; he added confidentially, &#8220;I used to be about with
Aymer a good bit and I thought I knew all&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; He
stopped abruptly. If he were being purposely tactless
he realised he had gone far enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not think Aymer ever met my mother. I am
certain you haven&#8217;t. Mr. Aston used to know her,
and suggested Aymer&#8217;s adopting me when he heard
I was left stranded in a workhouse. I was just a
workhouse boy. Now, are you satisfied as to my private
history, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; retorted the inquisitor good-humouredly as
ever, &#8220;you must have had a father, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems possible. I do not remember him.&#8221;</p>
<p>He began to resign himself to fate and this Juggernaut
of a man who rolled other people&#8217;s feelings
flat with no more compunction than a traction engine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fathers are useful. You may want to remember,
some-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite satisfied at present.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not suggesting you have anything to complain
of. Aymer doesn&#8217;t do things by halves. Christopher
is as much a family name as Aston, for example.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something in his tone caught Christopher&#8217;s attention
and he looked at him sharply. Peter Masters
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
was gazing straight before him with that same cynical
smile on his face it had worn when Christopher was
first introduced to him six years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder why on earth they did that?&#8221; ruminated
the Juggernaut. &#8220;Cousin Charles is capable of any
unworldly folly, but Aymer was a man of the world
once. It looks like colossal bluff.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then the meaning of all this swept over Christopher&#8217;s
mind like a wave of fire, scorching his soul,
desecrating and humiliating the very mainspring of
his life.</p>
<p>Aymer&#8217;s son! He knew Masters believed it as
surely as if he had blurted it out in his own unbearable
way, and it was not to save him, it was from no sense
of decency Masters had not said it audibly. Christopher
longed to fling the unspoken lie back to him, to
refuse the collaboration of detail that the passing
minutes crowded on his notice. He put on speed;
tried to outstrip the evil thought of it, to think only
of C&aelig;sar, the dear companion of his days, the steady
friend, the unobtrusive mentor and guide. But a
thought he could not outstrip slipped into his mind
so insidiously and stealthily, he could not tell how or
whence it came.</p>
<p>&#8220;You only know C&aelig;sar; you never knew Aymer
Aston of the silent past.&#8221;</p>
<p>Faster and faster rushed the car in futile attempt
to outpace the whispered treason. The speed indicator
stood at 40 and still mounted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to remark,&#8221; said Peter Masters
thoughtfully, &#8220;that I have not yet made my will and
it would cause some inconvenience to a vast number
of people to have several millions left masterless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an open road,&#8221; returned Christopher, &#8220;I know
what I&#8217;m at. I expect I enjoy life as much as you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>He slowed down suddenly, however, to about
twenty miles an hour to pass an old woman in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
donkey cart, and the hateful thought swept on in advance
apparently, for he overtook it again when their
speed ran up ten points.</p>
<p>Christopher had chosen a rather circuitous route
which offered fewer villages than the general high-road.
It was a glorious day, the banks were starry
with primroses, and all the hedgerows, just bursting
into green rosettes, were hunting ground for birds
innumerable.</p>
<p>Green emerald grass in water-meadows, fresh green
growth on the hillside, and red bud and green promise
hung from every tree. The crisp air whispered warnings
of frosts still to come, but braced the nerve and
gladdened the heart nevertheless, and called imperiously
to youth to seek its kingdom. Christopher was
at no pains to spare the nerves of the master of millions,
and though he invariably crept through villages
and towns sedately and drove with an eye for crossroads
and distant specks on the white track before
him, they swept through the open country with a
breathless rush.</p>
<p>How good it would have gone alone, Christopher
thought savagely, and resentment rose high in his
heart. He was going to meet Patricia for the first
time with understanding eyes. In the past months
his love had grown with steady insistence until the
imperious voice of spring, singing in concord with it,
had overridden the decision of his stubborn will, demanding
surrender, clamorous for recognition, and
now having allowed the claim he was again forced
back on the unsolved question of his own history. It
was as if some imp of mischief had coupled his love
to the Past, and had left him without knowledge to
loose the secret knot. The silence became intolerable
for fear of the next words that might break it from
his companion. It would be better to take control himself&mdash;so
he slackened speed a little and had the satisfaction
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
of hearing Peter Masters heave a relieved
sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;The roads here need re-making,&#8221; as they proceeded
bumpily over a rather bad piece of ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;For motors?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For everything. A road should be easy going for
motors, horses, and foot-passengers. Easy and safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How would you do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A raised causeway for walkers; a road for carriages,
and a track for motors. It only means so many
yards more and there is plenty of land. Look at that
turf&mdash;four yards of it. Might as well be road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to make your roads of?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher took a deep breath; the pace of the car
increased a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;That has to be found&mdash;will be found. It is a
question of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you mean to find it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A good many people mean to find it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Masters shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t pay you so well as iron, Master Christopher.
My offer is still open.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher was so surprised that he nearly swerved
into an unfenced pond they were passing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very kind of you to make it again,&#8221; Christopher
managed to stammer out, adding with a bluntness
worthy of Masters himself, &#8220;I never could understand
why you made it at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither do I,&#8221; returned Peter Masters with a
laugh, &#8220;and I generally know what I&#8217;m at. Perhaps
I thought it would please Aymer. As I told you just
now, we were friends before his accident. I suppose
you&#8217;ve heard all about that?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a brief moment Christopher felt temptation
grip him. He was convinced the man beside him knew
the untold story, and at this juncture in his life he
would give much to understand all those things he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
had never questioned or ventured to consider. Then
recognising disloyalty in the very thought, he hastened
to escape the pitfall. It was no use to take
half measures with this man, however, so he lied again
boldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I know,&#8221; and went back again to safer
ground. &#8220;Whatever your reasons, it was good of
you to think of me and kinder still to renew your offer.
I expect you will think me a silly fool of a boy to refuse
it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly; but a boy brought up by an Aymer
Aston the second.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is sufficient luck for one boy to grab out of
life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter Masters chuckled. &#8220;I take it, young man,
you&#8217;d rather be fathered by Aymer than by me, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher muttered a very fervent affirmative between
clenched teeth, which did not appear to reach his
hearer&#8217;s ears, for as Masters finished his own sentence
he shot a sudden, sharp, puzzled look at Christopher,
and his teeth shut together with a click. He spoke no
more and when Christopher hazarded a remark he got
no answer.</p>
<p>The glory of the day was at its height when Marden
came in sight; the whole world seemed to have
joined in a peon of thanksgiving which for the moment
drowned the unwonted echoes in Christopher&#8217;s
heart that Peter Masters&#8217;s hard voice had awoken.</p>
<p>Youth was his, Love was his, and Patricia was to
be his, and he was going to see her. He covered the
distance from the lodge gates to the house in a time
that taxed his companion&#8217;s nerve to the uttermost and
bid fair to outpace even the throbbing, rushing pulse
of spring that filled the land.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>
<p>Patricia was in the orchard, and not only in the
orchard, but of it, for she was comfortably perched on
a low bough of an ancient hoary apple tree. She had
a volume of Robert Bridges&#8217;s poems in her hand and
a thirst was on her to be at the edge of a cliff and
look over into blue space below. The secluded orchard
with its early crown of pink blushes, the serene shut-in
valley screened from cold winds and cradled between
the chalky highlands, weighed on her. She looked upwards
through the dainty tracery of soft green and
pink to the sky above, delicately blue with white clouds
racing over it. There was air up there, free and untrammelled.
Patricia sighed and then laughed at herself,
for it was good, even here in the narrow orchard,
life with its coming possibilities, its increasing riches.
She was glad to be alone at that moment if only to
share a thought with the poet who at this period held
sway over her mind.</p>
<p>The previous evening had been one of great moment
to her and she was joyfully thankful to find that
it obscured and clouded no particle of the daily simple
joy of her existence. She had claimed this day to
herself, free from all new issues to prove this point,
and her heart sang with content for what had been,
was, and would be.</p>
<p>The orchard gate clicked, and looking through the
intervening boughs and leaflets, she saw Christopher
coming across the grass towards her with his even,
swinging step.</p>
<p>In her rough grey dress she was as part of the
rough tree herself. Her golden head and the delicate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
lovely colouring of her face rivalled the tree&#8217;s darling
blossoms, so Christopher thought when he reached her.
He came straight to her through the maze of old and
young trees and had the exquisite joy of seeing her
flush with surprise and pleasure at sight of him. Here
indeed she felt was the one addition to her day that
she needed. She did not descend from her perch, and
it was his hand which steadied her there when excitement
imperilled her throne.</p>
<p>&#8220;To come down on us without warning like this!&#8221;
she expostulated, smiling down at him. &#8220;Why, we
might have had no leisure to see you or luncheon to
give you! When did you actually come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Half an hour and five minutes ago. I&#8217;ve seen
C&aelig;sar and St. Michael, and I&#8217;ve had luncheon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And have you come to stay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know yet.&#8221; He leant his arm on the
bough where she sat, which was of exactly convenient
height.</p>
<p>&#8220;The amount of leisure you seem to have on hand,&#8221;
said Patricia severely, &#8220;is outrageous, considering
how hard the rest of the family work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially Nevil,&#8221; laughed Christopher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially Nevil. We have not sat down to a
meal with him for three weeks. He nearly walked
on Max&#8217;s puppy last week and he has forgotten Charlotte&#8217;s
existence except as a penwiper&mdash;she went in
to him one morning with a message and came out
with an ink smudge on her red dress&mdash;she <i>said</i> it was
his pen&mdash;the dress is the same colour as the penwiper,
so she may be right. He paid no attention to the
message.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, at present, if you take the trouble to go into
the Rosery you will find Nevil lying by the fountain
catching goldfish with Max. I do not think he remembered
I&#8217;d been away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I am glad,&#8221; cried Patricia, clapping her hands;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
&#8220;of course it&#8217;s very nice of him to be so clever and
write so beautifully, but it&#8217;s much nicer when he&#8217;s just
a dear silly thing&mdash;and catches goldfish. But tell me
about yourself now. Are you well? And have you
been working hard? Why aren&#8217;t you in Belgium,
why have you come, and what are you going to do,
and when are you going back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop, I can&#8217;t keep more than five questions in my
head at once and I&#8217;ve answered several of yours already.
The first is trivial; you have eyes. I have
been working as usual; it&#8217;s no use to explain how, you
have no conception of work at all. I am not in Belgium
because I am here in a better place. I am going
to enjoy myself, I hope, and I shall go away when it
pleases me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, Your Highness. You have not explained
why you came.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Christopher, considering hard and
speaking with slow deliberation, &#8220;I <i>think</i>, only it is
so preposterously silly, that I came to see you, or perhaps
it was C&aelig;sar or Nevil if it were not Max.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patricia laughed deliciously and leant forward,
making pretence to box his ears. Christopher shook
the bough in revenge till she cried pax, and peace
supervened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since you have evidently no business of your own
to see to,&#8221; she said severely, &#8220;it shall be my business
to teach you to appreciate Robert Bridges.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like his name; who is he?&#8221; Christopher
grumbled.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a genius and you must sit at his feet and
listen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it respectful to stand?&#8221;</p>
<p>She regarded him gravely with her head on one
side. &#8220;True humility sits ill on you, I fear. You
may stand if you take off your hat.&#8221;</p>
<p>He flung it on the grass obediently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The Cliff Edge.&#8221; &#8220;The Cliff Edge has a carpet ... of purple,
gold, and green.&#8221;</p>
<p>She read the little poem all through, her sweet, appreciative
voice making music of the lines already
melodious. Christopher wondered if the writer ever
knew how beautiful his words could be made.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that not lovely?&#8221; she asked when she finished,
leaning forward so that her hand and the book rested
for a moment on his arm.</p>
<p>Christopher nodded without moving.</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes me thirsty for the sea,&#8221; she went on,
&#8220;for sky, for space to move and breathe. Oh, Christopher,
things here are either old or small. All the
great and beautiful things are old, the glory of it, the
house, the life, the very trees, old, old, old. And the
rest is small, protected and shut in. I want to feel
things that are young and free and great, as the sky
and sea and the wind. I am thirsty sometimes to
stand on the edge of the cliff and taste the free, free
air from off the sea that has no one else&#8217;s thoughts
in it. Do you understand that?&mdash;the longing for
something that does not belong to any part, to any
one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I understand. I feel it too, sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew you did. You see, it&#8217;s because neither of
us belong here&mdash;to Marden&mdash;really. Oh, I don&#8217;t
mean it horridly. It&#8217;s the dearest place and they are
all the dearest people; but the life, the big thought
of it all, isn&#8217;t ours. <i>Our</i> people didn&#8217;t help make it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher made no answer. He was idly flinging
bits of bark into his hat. If he were but certain&mdash;oh,
if he could but be certain she were right! He looked
up at her at last.</p>
<p>There could be no room for the grey shadows of
doubt any longer. She <i>was</i> right. He felt it as he
looked and as the thought she suggested sank deeper
into his mind. Was not he truly one with her in it?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
He, too, had been conscious of a Life and History
here at Marden not his own, that exacted no obligations
from him, but rather silently insisted on the freedom.
Such freedom, mated to hers, was the last great
boon he asked of life that had already given him so
much. Still he hesitated for very fear of losing the
joy of the hour that would be his and hers for eternity
when he sealed it with the passionate words in his
heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know just what you mean,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it is no
disloyalty to them to feel it&mdash;only loyalty to ourselves.
As for the sea and all that, I will motor you
down to Milford whenever you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Christopher!&#8221; She clasped her hands with
joy like a child. &#8220;Have you brought the new motor?
What is it like?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a perfect love, Patricia. I drove it down
from town to-day. Such a road, stones, ruts&mdash;and
it behaved like an angel although weighted with an
extra sixteen stone of colossal brutality&mdash;Peter Masters,
Esquire, millionaire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, why on earth did you bring him down here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did not ask permission. He just came&mdash;wanted
to see St. Michael. Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s talk about
him. Let&#8217;s talk about ourselves. We are much more
interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Egoist!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t the plural number cancel the egoism?
But I really have something to tell you about myself.
Two things, indeed, if you&#8217;ll kindly listen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will try to be polite. Proceed.&#8221; She ensconced
herself comfortably against the trunk of the tree,
folded her hands in her lap and smiled down at him
under her half-shut lids. He also moved his position
a very little so that he could see her better.</p>
<p>&#8220;First, then, Patricia, I have actually done something
in Belgium. The roads of which I have dreamed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
are not quite such fantastic fancies now as they were
a year ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat erect at once, alert and brimming over with
interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Christopher!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not done yet,&#8221; he went on slowly, &#8220;but it
is on the way to be done. It means that all the roads
here, and the roads all over the world, will one day be
made easy to travel upon. It means that mud, dirt
and noise will be evils of the past, and they will be
roads that will last down the ages.&#8221; He stopped with
a little catch in his breath and looked at her half
ashamed, half pleadingly.</p>
<p>But Patricia was gazing past him through a gap
in the trees at a white flinty road that struggled up
to the distant downs. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said very softly, as
if fearing to quench a vision she saw there, &#8220;yes,
that is a great and a good thing, and like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he answered laughing&mdash;the spell of
their mutual earnestness pressed him too sorely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t laugh,&#8221; she returned swiftly with a frown;
&#8220;it is not the goodness that&#8217;s like you. It&#8217;s a sort of
strongness about it&mdash;something to hold on to for all
time.&#8221; She stopped abruptly, looking at him gravely.</p>
<p>This time he did not laugh, but he put one hand on
hers, and his was shaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christopher,&#8221; she said coaxingly, &#8220;will you really
take me down to the sea when I like?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then do it this afternoon. Now, at once,&#8221; she
cried pleadingly, and seeing his face of amazement,
added, &#8220;you promised, Christopher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. I&#8217;ll do it; but why not to-morrow,
when we can have a long day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because&mdash;because to-day is all my own,&#8221; she said
softly, &#8220;and to-morrow isn&#8217;t. Christopher, I did not
mean to tell anyone to-day, but I must tell you, I am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
going to marry Geoffry,&#8221;&mdash;she flushed rosy red, but
he did not see it&mdash;&#8220;it was last night&mdash;he wanted to
see Nevil at once, but I wouldn&#8217;t let him. I wanted
this day to myself. It was nice of you to come and
make it complete.&#8221;</p>
<p>His hand still held hers, but it was still and motionless
now. She stroked it softly. Christopher drew
it gently away.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to wish me happiness or something,
ought you not?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do, Patricia,&#8221; he said, looking up at her.</p>
<p>He wanted to say more; self-preservation demanded
it, and again demanded silence. Their voices seemed
to him far away, speaking in some fairy orchard
where he was not. He could barely hear them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll pretend not to know anything about it till
to-morrow, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; she pleaded. &#8220;Don&#8217;t spoil
my day. It isn&#8217;t that it won&#8217;t be perfectly lovely to
be engaged, but the past has been, lovely too, and I
want to keep it a tiny bit longer. You&#8217;ll help me,
won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>If he could but keep to-day forever shut in his heart
with her, though life crumbled to ruins about them!
But the invincible hours were ranged against him, and
would claim it their own.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll take me to the sea?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if you come at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>She descended from her perch with his help. She
did not know his hands felt numb and dead as he held
and released her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t told me the second thing about yourself,&#8221;
she remarked, brushing the bark and lichen from
her dress.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will keep,&#8221; he said quietly.</p>
<p>And they went out of the orchard.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>
<p>Whatever may have been the pressing business that
caused Peter Masters to seek his cousin&#8217;s company in
so speedy a manner, the immediate necessity of it
seemed to have evaporated on the journey. He sat
talking of various things to Aymer and Charles Aston,
but uttered nothing as to the reason of his visit,
and Mr. Aston, with his eye on Aymer, chafed a little
and found it hard to maintain his usual serenity. Aymer,
on the contrary, seemed more deliberate and
placid than usual; there was a slowness in his speech,
and an unusual willingness to leave the conversation
in his visitor&#8217;s hands as if he mistrusted his own
powers to keep it in desirable channels. He appeared
to have suddenly abdicated his position on the objective
positive side of life and to have become a mere
passive instrument of the hour, subjective and unresisting.</p>
<p>It was his father who was ready, armed against
fate, alert, watchful to ward off all that might harm
or distress his eldest son. Peter spoke of their exodus
from London, their sojourn in the country, told them
anecdotes of big deals, and was, in his big, burly,
shrewd way, amusing and less ruthlessly tactless than
usual. He had long ago given up all hope of interesting
Aymer in a financial career, but he nevertheless
retained a curiously respectful belief in his cousin&#8217;s
mental powers.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; he said presently, &#8220;I&#8217;ve not bought
a car yet. That boy of yours seems to know something
about them. Do you think he could be trusted
to choose one for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perfectly.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>Aymer&#8217;s tone was completely impartial, and Peter
ruminated over his next remark a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You still mean him to stick to his Road Engineering?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is perfectly free to do as he likes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles Aston put in a word.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is twenty-two now, and he knows his own
mind a good deal better than most boys of that age.
He seems bent on carrying out his Road scheme, and
there seems no reason why he should not.&#8221; He
pushed over a box of cigars to his visitor.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, exactly. No reason at all.&#8221; Peter selected
a cigar carefully. &#8220;I expect you find it very interesting
watching how he turns out, don&#8217;t you, Aymer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not uninteresting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve not seen Nevil yet,&#8221; suggested Mr. Aston.
&#8220;He is just out of a spell of work; come out in
the garden and find him while you smoke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps we might, if you don&#8217;t mind being
left, Aymer?&#8221; Peter&#8217;s voice was full of kindly interest.
To him the great catastrophe was ever a new
and awful thing, and Aymer an invalid to be considered
and treated with such attention as he knew how.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the least,&#8221; said Aymer politely, marvelling
how exactly his father had gauged the limits of his
endurance. When the heavy curtained door had shut
out voices and footsteps and only the stillness of the
room was with him the forced passivity slipped from
Aymer like a mask, and his was again the face of a
fighter, of one still fighting against fearful odds.</p>
<p>He lay with clenched hands and rigid face, and
great beads of perspiration stood on his forehead, for
that passive indifference towards what had become a
matter of life and death to him was the fruit of a victory
that had to be won again and again each time his
perilous position was assailed by the appearance of
Peter Masters.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>His very existence had become so bound up in the
life of the boy he had taken as his own that the smallest
fraying of the cord which bound them together
was a thought of new pain. The passionate, fiercely
jealous nature that had lain dormant so long had
gathered strength from silence and clamoured with
imperious insistence on its right, to love, to whole allegiance,
to undisputed sway over Christopher.</p>
<p>What right could this man, Christopher&#8217;s father
though he were, in the flesh, show beside his, Aymer
Aston&#8217;s? Every instinct rose in indignant rebellion
against the fiat of his own conscience.</p>
<p>For before his deep love was awake to confuse his
judgment he had declared that if he might only be
permitted to bring Elizabeth Masters&#8217;s son through
the perilous passage of boyhood, he would never
stand between Christopher and what, after all, was his
right due, and in the eyes of the world, his wonderful
fortune. Elizabeth of the brave heart and uncompromising
creed had thought otherwise of this fortune,
as did Charles Aston and Aymer himself. The
first had imperilled her beloved child&#8217;s bodily welfare
to save him from what she thought an evil thing, and
the Astons, father and son, had bid defiance to their
hitherto straightforward policy and followed expediency
instead of open dealing, but there Aymer
stopped.</p>
<p>The decision he had made must be adhered to at
all costs. It mattered nothing he had not been in a
position to count the cost ten years ago. He at least
could not discount his own word. If Fate drew Christopher
to the side of his unknown father, Aymer must
put out no hand to intervene.</p>
<p>But the cost of it&mdash;the cost!&mdash;He put his shaking
hands over his face, trying to consider the position
reasonably.</p>
<p>Even if Peter Masters learnt the truth and claimed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>Christopher, Christopher was of age and must act for
himself, and Aymer could not doubt his action. His
misery lay in no suspicion of Christopher&#8217;s loyal love,
but in his own unconquerable, wildly jealous desire to
stand alone in the post of honour, of true fatherhood
to the son of the woman he had loved to such disastrous
end. And behind that lay the bitter, unquenchable
resentment that, pretend as he would, Christopher
was not his son, not even of unknown parentage, but
in actual fact the son of the man who had unknowingly
robbed him of love, and whom he had all his life
alternately hated and despised.</p>
<p>It was some subtle knowledge of what was passing
in that still room that made Charles Aston a shade less
kindly, a little more alert than usual to hidden meanings,
and it was the sight of Aymer&#8217;s apparent passivity
in the face of all that threatened him, that
brought him to the mind to fight every inch of ground
before he put into the hands of Peter Masters the tangled
clue of the story that he alone knew in all its completeness.</p>
<p>The suspicion that had gripped Peter Masters on
the journey down was slowly stiffening into a certainty,
but he was still undecided in his mind as to
the line of action he would take. If these people with
their ultra-heroic code of honour had fooled him, and
forestalled him in this matter of his son with deliberate
intent to frustrate any advances he might make, it
would go hard with them in the end, cousins or no
cousins. Such was his first thought; but he had yet
to prove they were not simply waiting for a sign to
deliver back his son to him, in which case Peter was
not unprepared to be grateful, for his heart&mdash;and he
had one&mdash;had gone out to the plucky, determined
young man who had lied so bravely. Peter determined,
therefore, he would give Charles Aston a chance and
see what happened. In a blindly, inarticulate way he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
felt it was impossible to play with Aymer, he was even
conscious it was a matter of great moment to him,
though he could not in any manner see why it was so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevil will survive if we put him off a little longer,&#8221;
said Peter as they crossed the hall, &#8220;I want to see you
on a private matter, Cousin Charles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Aston led the way without a word to his own
room. He made no doubt as to what the matter was.
Perhaps the shadow of the expected interview had lain
too heavily on him of late to leave room for suspicion
of other affairs.</p>
<p>It was a long, cheerful room, lined with books, and
the furniture was solid and shabby with long service.
There was an indefinite atmosphere of peace and repose
about it, of leisured days haunted by no grey
thoughts, very typical of the owner. The window
stood open, though a fire burned clearly on the plain
brick hearth, beneath a big hooded chimney-piece.</p>
<p>Mr. Aston indicated a big easy chair to his visitor
and seated himself at his writing table, from whence
he could see, behind Peter, on the far wall, a portrait
of Aymer painted in the pride of his life and youth,
so wonderfully like even now in its strong colour and
forcible power, and so full of subtle differences and
fine distinctions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know even if you&#8217;ll listen to me,&#8221; began
Peter, who knew very well Charles Aston would refuse
to listen to no man; &#8220;fifteen years ago you told
me you&#8217;d said your last word on the subject.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, Peter, it was you who said the
subject was closed between us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes. So I did. May I reopen it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it can serve any good purpose, but you know
my opinions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought perhaps they might have altered with
the changing years,&#8221; said Peter blandly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not one bit, I assure you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Really. It never strikes you that I was justified
in attending to Elizabeth&#8217;s very plainly expressed
wishes, or that it might be a happy thing for the boy
that I did so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The question between us,&#8221; said his cousin gently,
&#8220;was whether you were justified in abandoning them,
not whether it was advantageous to them or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would point out in passing, Cousin Charles, that
Elizabeth abandoned me, but we will let that be. My
reason for opening the subject at all is not a question
of justification.&#8221; He puffed away slowly at his cigar
for a minute and then went on in an even, unemotional
voice. &#8220;The fact is something rather strange
has happened. For twenty years I have believed I
knew the exact whereabouts of Elizabeth and my son.
I had a good reason for the belief. One man only
shared this supposititious knowledge with me.&#8221; His
hearer seemed about to speak, but desisted and looked
away from Peter out of the window. Not a movement,
a sign, a breath, escaped those hard blue eyes,
and Charles Aston knew it. It did not render him
nervous or even indignant, but he was a trifle more
dignified, more obviously determined to be courteous
at any cost.</p>
<p>&#8220;That boy and his mother were living at Liverpool,&#8221;
went on Peter calmly. &#8220;He was employed in
a big shipping firm in a very minor capacity. He was
killed in the great explosion in the dock last week.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke as calmly as if he were saying his supposed
son had lost his post or had gone for a holiday.</p>
<p>Charles Aston gave a sudden movement and turned
a shocked face towards the speaker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Terrible!&#8221; he said, &#8220;I wonder how the shareholders
in that company feel? Did you see the verdict?&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter waved his hand. &#8221;Yes, yes. Juries lose their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
heads in these cases. But to continue. I went down
to Liverpool at once before the funeral, you understand.&#8221;
He paused. &#8220;I was naturally much disturbed
and horrified, and then&mdash;well, the boy wasn&#8217;t
my son, after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not your son?&#8221; echoed Charles Aston slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not my son.&#8221; There was a tinge of impatience
in his voice. &#8220;I should not have known, but
the mother was there. She went in as I came out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His mother was alive?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. She was not Elizabeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>His cousin turned to him, indignation blazing in
his eyes. &#8220;For twenty years, Peter, you believed you
knew your wife&#8217;s whereabouts, you knew she was in
more or less a state of poverty, and you made no attempt
to see her face to face? You accepted the story
of another with no attempt to personally prove the
truth yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had good reason to believe it,&#8221; returned Peter
sulkily. &#8220;She would have let me know if she were
in want. I had told her she could come back when
she had had enough of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And this poor woman, whose son was killed.
What of her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about her except she wasn&#8217;t
Elizabeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You had believed her so for twenty years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had made a mistake. She knew nothing about
that. I took good care she should not. There was
no doubt about her being the boy&#8217;s mother, and no
doubt she was not Elizabeth. She had no claim on
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No claim!&#8221; Charles Aston stood up and faced
him, &#8220;not even the claim of the widow&mdash;her one son
dead. No claim, when for all those years those two
items of humanity represented in your perverse mind
the two people nearest&mdash;I won&#8217;t say dearest&mdash;to you.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
No claim!&#8221; He stopped and walked away to the
window.</p>
<p>Peter smiled tolerantly. He enjoyed making this
kind, generous man flash out with indignation. It
was all very high-flown and impossible, but it suited
Charles Aston. To-day, however, he was too engrossed
in his own affairs to get much satisfaction
from it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, don&#8217;t let us argue about it. We don&#8217;t
think alike in these matters. The point I want to consult
you about is not my susceptibility to sentiment,
but the chances of my picking up a clue twenty years
old.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say they were hardly worth considering.&#8221;
He spoke deliberately, turning from the window to
resume his place by the table. The fight had begun;
they had crossed blades at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a very good detective called Chance and
a better one called Luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have secured their services?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not certain yet. Can you help me?&#8221;</p>
<p>He made the appeal with calculated directness,
knowing his man and his aversion to evasion, but if
he expected him to hesitate he was disappointed.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I can do nothing. I tried for five years to
bring you to some sense of your responsibility in this
matter. You were not frank with me then, it seems.
I can do nothing now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And have lost all interest in it, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. It is your interest that rises and falls with
the occasion, but I decline to have anything to do with
it. If&mdash;as I do not believe&mdash;Elizabeth is still alive
she and your son have done without your help for
twenty years and can do without it still.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They have doubtless plenty of friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us hope so. What was the name of the Liverpool
woman?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Priestly. What does it matter? The question is,
I must find my son somehow, for I must have an
heir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Adopt one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As did Aymer?&#8221; He shot a questioning glance
at him. &#8220;It&#8217;s such a risk. I might not be so lucky.
Sons like Christopher are not to be had for nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they are not,&#8221; said Charles Aston drily.
&#8220;They are the result of years of love and patience, of
generous tolerance, of unquenchable courage. They
bring days of joy which must be paid for with hours
of anxiety and nights of pain. Were you prepared to
give your son this, even if you had taken him to you
as a boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter waved his big hand again. &#8220;I quite admit
all that is needed to produce men of your pattern,
Cousin Charles, and I have the profoundest admiration
for the result; but I am not ambitious; I should
be content to produce the ordinary successful man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Christopher will score a success.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, in spite of you both, by reason of his practical,
determined, hard-headed nature which he probably
inherits from his father, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are probably right. I am not in a position
to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did not know his parents?&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles Aston pushed back his chair and looked beyond
Peter to the portrait of Aymer. They must
come to close quarters or he would give out, and suddenly
it came to him that he must adhere to his universal
rule, must give the better side of the man&#8217;s nature
a chance before he openly defied him. The decision
was made quite quickly. Peter only recognised
a slight pause. &#8220;You seem interested in Christopher,&#8221;
Mr. Aston said slowly. &#8220;I will tell you what there
is to know. About eleven years ago Aymer became
possessed of a passionate desire to have a boy to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
bring up, since he might not have one of his own. In
hunting for a suitable one I stumbled on the son of
someone I had known who had fallen on very evil
days.&#8221; He stopped a moment. Peter took out another
cigar and lit it. &#8220;On very evil days,&#8221; repeated the
other. &#8220;The boy was left at a country workhouse in
this county as it happened. I knew enough of his paternity
to know that he was a suitable subject for Aymer
to father. I have never regretted what I did. The
boy has become the mainspring of Aymer&#8217;s life; he
lives again in him. All that has been denied him, he
finds in Christopher&#8217;s career; all he cannot give the
world he has given to this boy, this son of his heart
and soul. No father could love more, could suffer
more. And Christopher is repaying him. He has
known no father but Aymer, no authority but his, no
conflicting claim. I pray God daily that neither now
nor in the future shall any shadow fall between these
two to cancel by one solitary item Christopher&#8217;s obligation
to his adopted father. Perhaps I am selfish
over it, but anyway, Aymer is my son, and I understand
how it is with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a silence in the room. Peter puffed
vehemently and the clouds of blue-grey smoke circling
round him obscured the heavy features from his
cousin when his eyes left the picture to look at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I see. Quite so,&#8221; said a voice from the
smoke at last, and slowly the strong, bland expressionless
face emerged clearly from the halo, &#8220;but I am no
further on my way towards my son. And who&#8217;s to
have the money if I don&#8217;t find him? Will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heaven forbid!&mdash;and Nature! Peter, I&#8217;m sixty
and you are fifty-four.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will Nevil&#8217;s boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have enough. We should count it a misfortune.
Leave it in charities.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And suppose he discovers some day who he is, and
wanted it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly likely after so long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite likely. Shall I leave it to Christopher?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the last thrust, and it told. There was quite
a long silence. Charles longed passionately to refuse,
but even he dared not. The issue was too great.
&#8220;I cannot dictate to you in the matter,&#8221; he said at
length, &#8220;but I do not think Christopher would appreciate
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I must hope to find a Christopher of my
own,&#8221; returned Peter, rising; &#8220;let us meanwhile find
Nevil.&#8221;</p>
<p>The duel was over and apparently the result was as
undetermined as ever. The only satisfaction poor
Charles Aston derived was from the fact that Peter
was unusually gentle and tactful to Aymer that afternoon.
He seemed in no hurry to go, urged as excuse
he wanted to consult Christopher about a motor, but
when they sent to find that young gentleman, they
discovered he and Patricia and the motor were
missing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>
<p>It seemed to Christopher as he overhauled his long-suffering
motor preparatory to the new run, that a
great gap of innumerable grey days stretched between
him and the moment he brought the car to a standstill
before the doors of the house, that had appeared
to him to be a Temple of Promise. It was in fact barely
an hour and a half and the greater part of that time
had been occupied with lunch and a hasty interview
with Aymer. That shorter interlude in the orchard
just over, had already blotted out a golden landscape
with a driving mist that obscured all true proportion
of time or space. He longed greatly, with a sense of
strange fatigue, to be sitting at C&aelig;sar&#8217;s side and to
find the restless discomfort evaporate as they talked,
even as his boyish troubles had melted in that companionship.
That must come later: for the present
Fate&mdash;or Patricia&mdash;made a demand on him to which
he was bound to answer. Where a weaker nature
would have said &#8220;impossible,&#8221; he simply found an
ordinary action rendered difficult by his own private
view of it, therefore it behooved him to close the shutters
on that outlook if he could, and ignore the difficulty.</p>
<p>Renata, who came out with Patricia, protested a
little indignantly at the latter&#8217;s exaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is so inconsiderate of Patricia, just as you have
had such a journey. Why do you give in to her,
Christopher?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-day is as good as any day,&#8221; he answered her,
&#8220;perhaps the visitor will have gone when we return.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope so,&#8221; said Renata fervently, and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
blushed at her own inhospitality. &#8220;I mean, C&aelig;sar
would rather have you to himself, I am sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I would rather have C&aelig;sar unaccompanied.
So there is some use in Patricia&#8217;s fancy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; put in that young lady, &#8220;there always
is. Please do not waste precious time talking. Tell
me where I am to sit, Christopher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take every care of her,&#8221; said Christopher,
looking at Renata, &#8220;we&#8217;ll be back in time for dinner.
Be kind and get rid of Mr. Masters by then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like a dear little angel,&#8221; concluded Patricia, kissing
her; &#8220;think how he bores Nevil, and don&#8217;t be
hospitable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher settled her in the seat beside him,
tucked her in with rugs, put up the front screen and
started.</p>
<p>For a few short minutes the joy of having her
there beside him, his sole charge for some golden hours
to come, his to carry in a mad rush if he would to
the ends of the earth, obliterated for a moment the
bewildering mist.</p>
<p>He drove for some way in silence. Patricia was
too much absorbed in the pleasures of swift motion to
talk. Her first words, however, shut down the mists
on him again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Geoffry must have a car,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;He
must get one just like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought Geoffry was to be left behind this afternoon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I suppose he was. I don&#8217;t believe you are a
bit pleased about it really, Christopher.&#8221;</p>
<p>He clutched at the truth as a plank of safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you can&#8217;t expect me to be glad to lose your
company, can you? I shall never make a golfer
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed at that and recommended a course at
St. Andrew&#8217;s under a professional, which proposal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
he treated with scorn, but after a short silence he said
in a different voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m not glad at anything that makes
you happy, Patricia. Geoffry&#8217;s a real good sort and&mdash;here&#8217;s
a town&mdash;you must not speak to the man at
the wheel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patricia was obedient. She sank into a reverie in
which, despite her own determination, Geoffry played
a long part. It was characteristic of her exact attitude
towards her accepted lover that it was the immediate
future in which he figured most clearly. Her
thoughts hovered round the pleasant summer to come
with the distant excitement of a wedding to crown
it. She never considered, or only in the most cursory
way, the long years ahead, the daily companionship
with the man she had chosen. She was honestly
attached to Geoffry. She believed she was in love
with him, whereas, as is far more often the case than
the young suppose, she was in love with the love that
had come to her in the glory of the spring, offered by
familiar hands that were dear because of what they
held for her.</p>
<p>So they drove through the glowing afternoon, and
the line of white road before them appeared to Christopher
as a track dividing past and future, the thin
edge of the passing minutes. They spoke no more,
however, on the forbidden subject. Christopher presently
explained to her the visible mechanism of the
car and on a stretch of clear road let her put her hands
on the wheel beneath his own and feel the joy of
fictitious control. Before the sun quenched itself in
the sea they stood on the Cliff Edge and looked out
across the shining waters into the great space, where
a thought-laden air renews itself, reforming, cancelling
and creating in the crucible of Life. They clambered
down from the lip of the cliff on to a jutting-out
shelf of rock, screened with gorse, where the few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
feet of gravel bank behind them shut out all signs of
habitation.</p>
<p>Patricia sat with her hands clasped round her knees
drawing slow, deep draughts of the cool air, her eyes
on the immense free space, and she spoke not at all
with her lips, yet Christopher, lying at her feet, caught
her thoughts as they came and went with strange certainty
and stranger heartache. He picked a handful
of golden gorse petals and pressed the sweet blossoms
to his face: ever after their scent was to mean for him
that place and rapture of that hour, in which was
borne to him the certainty of his right to her, and the
knowledge of the surrender he was making in each
silent minute. For she was his now, if he told her, if
he broke faith, if he claimed the right that was his.</p>
<p>Now in this golden hour he would win if he spoke,
sweeping aside the shadowy intervening form of the
other with the relentless persistent truth of the faith
that was in him, a faith that had no ground in personal
vanity or individual pride, but was only the
recognition of a great Fact that lay outside and beyond
them both, that named Patricia forever his in a world
where the Real is disentangled from the Appearance.</p>
<p>Was life to consist, for him, in a relinquishing of
his own rights in conformity to the Law of Appearance?
Was it but a cowardly fear of convention that
held him back from claiming her now on the verge of
the world? Or was it a deeper, half-understood trust
of the Great Realities of Life, a knowledge that faith,
integrity, and honour are no conventions, but belong
to Real World of Truth, and that he could snatch no
joy of life over their trampled forms? He tried dimly
to understand these things, to gauge the nature of the
forces that controlled him, but he never doubted what
force would claim his obedience. It was already habitual
to him by reason of training and instinct to set
such Laws of Life as he recognised before his own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
will. But that will was very clamorous this evening
as he pressed the hot yellow whin-flowers to his face
drinking their fragrance into his thirsty soul.</p>
<p>When he raised his eyes he looked out at sea and
sky and avoided the dear sweet face above him. She
still sat smiling out into the serene space, watching as
it were the random thoughts of her subconscious self
floating in those ethereal realms. It was almost too
great a happiness for peace, the fair world, the comprehending
companion, who understood without the
clumsy medium of words, and the love awaiting her on
the morrow. She did not wish for Geoffry&#8217;s presence
now, she was perfectly content that he stood in the
beautiful morrow, that he was bringing her a good and
precious crown to the golden days of her youth.</p>
<p>She sighed out of pure joy and so broke the spell
of the golden and blue-cloaked silence which had
reigned. Without moving she gathered a handful of
whin blooms and scattered them over the brown head
at her feet, a baptism of golden fire. He shook them
off and looked up at her, laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Asleep, I believe, Christopher, you lazy person.
What were you dreaming about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bees, heather and honey,&#8221; he murmured, surreptitiously
gathering up a handful of the golden rain she
had tossed him. &#8220;Have you had your breath of freedom,
Patricia&mdash;are you ready for tea and buttered
toast?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And honey, you provoking materialist,&#8221; she insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Honey is stolen property&mdash;I always feel a consort
of thieves when I eat it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll eat it and you can shut your eyes. Christopher,
suppose the car goes wrong on the way
home?&#8221;</p>
<p>He scoffed at that, but while she ate her honey he
made an exhaustive inspection of it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>When the sun dropped out of sight a shivering wind
sprang up and the blue sky drew a grey cloak over
itself. Christopher wrapped his companion in a fur
coat and tucked her in anxiously.</p>
<p>She had become restless and dissatisfied as if the
sun had taken her joy to rest with him, or as if the
thoughts gathered from space found an unready lodgment
in her mind. Christopher made some effort to
talk on indifferent subjects, but she answered with
strange brevity or not at all, once with such impatience
that he glanced quickly at her hands and saw they were
hidden by the long sleeves of his big coat she wore.</p>
<p>Presently she said abruptly:</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought not to have stayed so long. Why did
you go to sleep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; he retorted, amazed at the accusation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you ought to have talked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought we were superior to such conventions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is an excuse for sheer laziness on your part.
And even if you are superior,&#8221; she added, inconsequently,
&#8220;I am not. What were you thinking
about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I tell you of what you were thinking?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out in the great space you saw all the future days
weaving for you a dress of blue and gold, of hopes
and fulfilment. You saw how they smiled at you, you
were glad of the love they bore you, the good they
were bringing you. You felt in your own soul how
you belonged to them, you were a part of all this dear
living world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t,&#8221; she cried, half under her breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it true?&#8221; he insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have no business, no right to know. Christopher,
how dare you.&#8221; Her face flushed with inward
emotion, with some fierce resentment that laid hold of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
her senses without reason and dragged fear in its
wake.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he said humbly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve often done it
before and you never minded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite different now. It&#8217;s unbearable. I don&#8217;t
like it any more, I hate it. Do you hear, Christopher?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It was unpardonable. I am sorry, Patricia,
I won&#8217;t do it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t try to understand me like that?
Promise,&#8221; she urged.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t try then. I only knew. I promise I won&#8217;t
tell you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not enough,&#8221; she persisted, twisting her
fingers under cover of the long sleeves. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t
know. You must not be able to do it. I won&#8217;t bear
it. Do you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve promised all I can. I certainly won&#8217;t try to
know. I can&#8217;t help it involuntarily.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must. I insist&mdash;Christopher, quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were running at a great pace along a straight
level piece of road with high banks on either side, and
by the roadside at regular intervals were piles of
broken granite. Christopher&#8217;s attention was fixed on
a distant speck that might be a danger-signal and he
did not answer her or notice the nearer signal of danger
in her white face.</p>
<p>She was in the grip of her old wild passion again,
on fire with her need of assurance, and in a gust of
anger she caught at the wheel that seemed to claim his
mind. The car swerved violently, jolted up on to the
turf, bumped madly along at a dangerous tilt, swerved
back into the road two feet clear of a grey pile of
stone. Only then did Christopher know her fingers
were gripped between his hands and the steel wheel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
He brought the car to a standstill and her released
hand fell white and numb to her side. She neither
spoke nor moved, but gazed before her, oblivious even
of her crushed fingers.</p>
<p>There was a running brook the other side of the
hedge and a convenient gate. He soaked his handkerchief
in it, came back to her and put the numbed hand
on the cool linen. His grip had been like iron and the
averted disaster so near as to be hardly passed from
his senses, yet he felt sick and ashamed at this almost
trifling price they had to pay. He felt each bruised
finger carefully and bound them up as best he could,
and only then did he speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fearfully sorry, Patricia, I didn&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked vaguely at the white bound hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;My fingers? Oh, I&#8217;m glad. You shouldn&#8217;t have
tied them up.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paid no heed, but having examined the car,
climbed back to his place.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must go on,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;so it&#8217;s no use
asking you if you are too frightened, Patricia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might put me out on the roadside,&#8221; she suggested
dully.</p>
<p>To that, too, he paid no heed and they started again.</p>
<p>The miles slipped by in unbroken silence. It was
not till they were nearly home that Christopher spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought that was all quite gone, Patricia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So did I,&#8221; she returned wearily. &#8220;It&#8217;s ages since
I was so stupid. It&#8217;s generally all right if you are
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not always there anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean there really. I just shut my eyes
and pretend you are and hold on. But just now I
waited for you to do something. I forgot you were
driving.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t rely on me to stop you now,&#8221; he insisted,
with new gravity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I do. It&#8217;s always you if I stop in time;
either you actually, or thinking of you. Don&#8217;t talk
about it, Christopher dear, it was too horrible.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not explain if she meant the danger or the
cause, but he obeyed and said no more. A terrible
fear clamoured at his heart. Did Geoffry Leverson
know or did he not? and if he knew, would he even
understand? He tried to tell himself that if he could
manage her, then another, and that her acknowledged
lover, could do so too, but he knew this was false
reasoning. Such power as he had over her lay in his
recognition that the irresistible inheritance was not
an integral part of Patricia, but was an exotic growth,
foisted upon her by the ill-understood laws of paternity,
and finding no natural soil in her pure self&mdash;something
indeed, of a lower nature, that she must and
could override. He could have curbed it in the brief
flash just over, he knew, had his attention been free.
It had died as it had come and the penalty of the
crushed fingers hurt him as unwarrantable, combined
with the peril they had run.</p>
<p>It was a fresh addition of cloud to the dimmed day
to find Peter Masters had not departed, but was staying
the night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>
<p>Aymer gazed out of the open window at Christopher
and Peter Masters as they walked to and fro on the
terrace. He knew the subject they were discussing,
and he was already sure how it would end. But what
were the real issues involved he could not determine,
and he was impotent, by reason of his vow and will,
to influence them. He could only lie still and watch,
tortured by jealous fear and the physical helplessness
that forbade him the one relief of movement for which
his soul craved. The patience the long years had
schooled him into was slipping away, and the elementary
forces of his nature reigned in its stead.</p>
<p>Under the overmastering impulse towards action he
made a futile effort to sit up that he might better follow
the movements of the two outside. It was a pathetic
failure, and he swore fiercely as he fell back and
found his father&#8217;s arms round him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aymer, if you are going to be so childish, I shall
tell Christopher not to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m a fool, but I won&#8217;t have him know it.
He must go if he will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing to fear if he does. What is
wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to go back to town, I&#8217;m tired of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are far better here than in town,&#8221; said his
father uneasily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m well enough anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall have to tell Christopher not to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; The tone was sharply negative again, and
after a moment&#8217;s silence Aymer said in a low, grudging
voice, &#8220;You&#8217;ve always helped before; are you going
to desert me now?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></p>
<p>For answer his father got up and pushed the big
sliding sofa away from the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, then behave yourself better, Aymer,
and don&#8217;t ford a stream before you come to it. You&#8217;ve
got to listen to Penruddock&#8217;s speech.&#8221; He folded back
the <i>Times</i> and began to read.</p>
<p>When Christopher came back a little later he saw
no sign of the trouble. Perhaps he was a little too
much engrossed in his own perplexities to be as observant
as usual.</p>
<p>&#8220;C&aelig;sar, do you think it&#8217;s a shabby thing to stay
with a man you don&#8217;t like?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so. I want to see how he does it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Makes his money. Does it seem shabby to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t know if you like him or not. You
know nothing about him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be back at the end of the week. You don&#8217;t
mind my going, C&aelig;sar? I&#8217;d rather go before I settle
down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Another week&#8217;s peace,&#8221; returned C&aelig;sar, indifferently.
&#8220;The truth is, you&#8217;re in a scrape and putting
off confession, young man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher laughed at him.</p>
<p>They were to leave early next morning, so Peter
Masters bade Aymer good-bye that night. He apologised
clumsily for taking Christopher away so soon
after his long absence.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only free week I&#8217;ve got for months, and
I want to study your handiwork, Aymer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Christopher has points. I don&#8217;t know how many
score to me,&#8221; returned his cousin with steadily forced
indifference.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve taken more trouble over him than
most fathers would do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you an expert?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>Peter laughed grimly and stood looking at Aymer
with his chin in his hand, a curiously characteristic
attitude of doubt with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t be overpleased when he wants to
marry, which he is sure to do just when he&#8217;s become
useful to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time in his life Peter Masters recognised
the harassed soul of a man as it leapt to sight,
and saw the shadow of pain conquer a fierce will.
The revelation struck him dumb, for incongruously and
unreasonably there flashed before his mind a memory
of this face with twenty years wiped out. He went
slowly away carrying with him a vivid impression and
new knowledge.</p>
<p>It was a new experience to him. He knew something
of men&#8217;s minds, but of their emotions and the
passions of their souls he was no judge. He puzzled
over the meaning of what he had seen as he faced
Christopher in the train next day, studying him with
a disconcerting gaze. Could Aymer possibly love the
boy to the verge of jealousy? It seemed so incredible
and absurd. Yet what other interpretation could he
place on that look he had surprised? Charles Aston&#8217;s
words, which had not been without effect, paled before
this self-revelation. It annoyed him greatly that the
disturbing vision should intrude itself between him
and the decision he was endeavouring to make, for
the better termination of which he was carrying Christopher
northward with him.</p>
<p>Christopher, on his part, was chiefly occupied in
considering the distracting fact of his own yielding
to the wishes of a man he disliked as sincerely as he
did Mr. Aston&#8217;s cousin. Peter Masters was taking
him with him in precisely the same manner he had
made Christopher convey him to Marden. It was
quite useless to pretend he was going of his own will;
refusal had, in an unaccountable way, seemed impossible.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
To save his pride he tried to believe he was
influenced by a desire to get away from Marden
until the first excitement over Patricia&#8217;s engagement
had died away, yet in his heart he knew that though
that and other considerations had joined forces with
the millionaire&#8217;s mandate, yet in any case he would
have had to bow to the will of the man who admitted
no possibility of refusal. He had been unprepared
and unready twice over: in the matter of the journey
from London and in the stranger matter of this present
journey. Christopher determined the third time
he would be on guard, that in all events, reason should
have her say in the case.</p>
<p>They were going direct to Stormly, which was midway
between Birmingham and the Stormly mines,
from which the fortunes of the family had first been
dug. Stormly Park was Peter&#8217;s only permanent residence,
though much of his time was spent in hotels
and travelling. The house, begun by his father, had
expanded with the fortunes of the son. It stood remote
from town or village. It was neither a palace
nor a glorified villa, but just a substantial house, with
an unprepossessing exterior, and all the marvels of
modern luxury within. The short private railway by
which it was approaching ran through an ugly tract of
country terminating beneath a high belt of trees that
shut off the western sun and were flanked by granite
walls.</p>
<p>On the platform of the minute station two porters
in private uniform received them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I generally walk up if I&#8217;m not in a hurry,&#8221; said
Peter Masters abruptly.</p>
<p>He had not spoken since they left Birmingham,
where a packet of letters had been brought him, to
which he gave his undivided attention. With a curt
nod to the men, with whom he exchanged no word at
all, he led the way from the siding across a black,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
gritty road and unlocking a door in the wall ushered
Christopher into Stormly Park.</p>
<p>The belt of trees was planted on a ridge of ground
that sloped towards the road and formed a second
barrier between the world without and the world
within. When they had crossed the ridge and looked
down on the Park itself Christopher gave a gasp of
astonishment. It stretched out before him in the sunset
light a wide expanse of green land, with stately
clumps of trees and long vistas of avenues that led
nowhere. It was like some jewel in the wide circling
belt of trees. It was so strange a contrast to the sordid
country without, that the effect was amazing.
Christopher looked round involuntarily to see by what
passage he had passed from that unpleasing world to
this sunkissed land of beauty.</p>
<p>Peter Masters saw the effect produced and his lips
twitched with a little smile of pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;My grandfather planted the place,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He
understood those things. I don&#8217;t. But it&#8217;s pretty.
My mother, Evelyn Aston, you know, used to always
travel by night if she could, she disliked the country
round so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is rather a striking contrast,&#8221; Christopher
agreed.</p>
<p>They passed through a clump of chestnuts just
breaking into leaf.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is coal here,&#8221; said Peter. &#8220;It will all have
to go some day. I make no additions now.&#8221;</p>
<p>They came suddenly on the house, which was built
of grey pointed stone, its low-angle slate roof hidden
behind a high balustrading. The centre part was evidently
the original house and long curved wings had
been extended on either side. There was no sign of
life about the place, nor did it carry the placid sense
of repose that haunts old houses. Stormly Park had
an air of waiting; a certain grim expectation lurked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
behind the over-mantled windows and closed doors.
It was as if it watched for the fate foreshadowed in
its owner&#8217;s words. Even the glorious sunlight pouring
over it failed to give it a sense of warm living
life.</p>
<p>It filled Christopher with curiosity and a desire to
explore the grey fastness and trim level lawns beyond.
Some living eyes watched, however, for the front door
swung open as they approached and two footmen came
out. Christopher again noted Peter Masters did not
speak to them or appear to notice their presence. On
the steps he paused, and stood aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go in,&#8221; he said when his visitor hesitated.</p>
<p>Christopher obeyed.</p>
<p>The interior was almost as great a contrast to the
exterior as the Park was to the surrounding country.
It was rich with colour and warmth and comfort.</p>
<p>They were met by a thin, straightened-looking individual,
who murmured a greeting to which Peter
Masters paid no attention.</p>
<p>He turned to Christopher.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Mr. Dreket, my secretary. Dreket, show
Mr. &#8211;&#8211;&#8221; for an imperceptible moment he paused&mdash;&#8220;Mr.
Aston his room and explain the ways of the
place to him. I&#8217;ve some letters to see to.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned aside down a long corridor. Christopher
and the secretary looked at each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t be sorry for a wash and brush up,&#8221; said
Christopher, smiling.</p>
<p>The other gave a little sigh, expressive more of relief
than fatigue, and led the way upstairs. As they
went up the wide marble steps Mr. Masters reappeared
and stood for a moment in the shadow of an arch
watching the dark, erect young head till it was out of
sight, then he retraced his steps and disappeared in his
own room.</p>
<p>Christopher did not see him again till dinner-time.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
The two dined together at a small table that was an
oasis in a desert of space. The room was hung with
modern pictures set in unpolished wood panelling.
Peter vaguely apologised for them to one accustomed
to the company of the masterpieces of the dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no judge. I should be taken in if I bought
old ones,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So I buy new, provided they
are by possible men. They may be worth something,
some day, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are very good to look at now,&#8221; Christopher
answered, a little shyly, looking at a vast sea-scape
which seemed to cool the room with a fresh breeze.</p>
<p>&#8220;You Astons would have beaten me anyhow,&#8221; pursued
Peter. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got nothing old: but the new&#8217;s the
best of its kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher found this was true. Everything in the
house was modern. There was no reproduction, no
imitation. It was all solidly and emphatically modern:
glass, china, furniture, books, pictures, the silk hangings,
the white statuary in the orangery: all modern.
There was nothing poor or mean or artistically
bad, but the whole gave an impression of life yet to
be lived, an incompleteness that was baffling in its obscurity.</p>
<p>Peter Masters talked much of events, of material
things, of himself, but never of mankind in general.
He spoke of no friends, or neighbours: he appeared
to be served by machines, to stand alone in life, unconscious
of his isolation. They played billiards in the
evening and the host had an easy victory, and gave
Christopher a practical lesson in the one game he had
found time to master.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve work to do. Breakfast to-morrow at 8 sharp.
You are going to Birmingham with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>No question about it or pretence of asking his visitor&#8217;s
wishes. Christopher did not resent that, but he
resented his growing inability to resist. He flung
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
open the windows of his room and looked out. Eastward
there was a glow in the sky over the great sleepless
city: northward a still nearer glow from a foundry,
he thought, but westward the parkland was silvered
with moonlight and black with shadows, which
under the groups of chestnuts seemed like moving
shapes.</p>
<p>He leant out far and the cold night air shivered by.
That was familiar and good to feel, but the glare
northward caught his eyes again, and held him fascinated.
It rose and fell, now blushing softly against
a velvet sky, now flaring angrily to heaven. It seemed
to quiver with voices that were harsh and threatening.
It filled Christopher&#8217;s heart with unreasonable horror
against which he struggled in vain, as with the dim
terror of a stranger. At last he closed the window
and shut it out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it,&#8221; said Christopher half aloud. &#8220;It&#8217;s
all right, it&#8217;s only a foundry, but I hate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that he went to bed and in the dark the dance
of the fires flickered before his eyes.</p>
<p>The next few days were spent in gathering fresh
impressions and disentangling bewildering experiences,
and in small encounters with the unanswerable
will of his host.</p>
<p>He was taken to the great offices in Birmingham,
and the wonderful system by which each vast machine
was worked was explained to him. He was even
privileged to sit with the great man in the inner sanctum
and copy letters for him, though he was summarily
turned out to see the sights of the great city
when a visitor was announced. He explored the
depths of the coal mines and finally spent a long morning
at the foundry whose nightly glare still haunted
his dreams. It was the latter sight that Peter Masters
evidently expected would interest him most, for
here were employed the most marvellous and most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
complicated modern machinery, colossal innovations
and ingenious labour-saving inventions in vast orderly
buildings; the complex whole obedient to an organisation
that left no item of power incomplete or wasted.
But Christopher gave but half his mind to all he was
shown, the other half was on those still stranger machines,
the grimy, brutal-looking workmen toiling in
the hot heart of the place, the white-faced stooping
forms on the outskirts. They eyed him aslant as they
worked, for visitors were rare occurrences. He asked
questions concerning them and received vague answers,
and a new machine was offered for inspection.</p>
<p>Fulner, the young engineer who had been told off
to show him round, understood what was expected of
him and did his duty. Masters himself, though he
accompanied them, apparently put himself also in Fulner&#8217;s
hands; he took no particular interest in the work,
but his eye followed every movement of Christopher&#8217;s
and his ear strained to his questions. Christopher
noticed that none but heads of departments paid any
attention to the owner&#8217;s presence, and he would have
thought him unknown but for a word or two he
caught as he lingered for a last look at a particularly
fascinating electric lathe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thinks he&#8217;s master,&#8221; grinned one man, with a
shrug, towards the retreating form.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thinks we&#8217;re part of his blasted machinery,&#8221;
growled his fellow worker.</p>
<p>Christopher passed on and forgot the lathe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do these people live?&#8221; he asked in the
comparative quiet of a store yard.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the&mdash;the villages round, and as near as they
can,&#8221; said the engineer quietly and looked back. Mr.
Masters had gone off to the store-keeper&#8217;s office and
was out of hearing. Fulner looked at Christopher
again and apparently came to a decision.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is difficult, sometimes, this housing question,&#8221;
he said swiftly, &#8220;are you really interested?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I want to know what contrast they get to
this. It&#8217;s overpowering, this place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If there was time&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; began the other, and
stopped, seeing Mr. Masters was approaching. He
was followed by a harassed-face sub-manager, who
waited uneasily a few yards off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christopher, I shall have to stay here an hour or
two. You had better go back. You can catch the
12.40 at the station. Fulner will see you there.&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded to the engineer and strode off towards
the main offices.</p>
<p>The sub-manager exchanged a look of consternation
with Fulner before he followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go this way,&#8221; said Fulner, leading Christopher
to a new corner of the great enclosure, &#8220;that is,
if you don&#8217;t mind walking.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not speak again until they were outside the
high walls that surrounded the works, then he looked
quizzically at Christopher.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall see where they live if you wish to,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;the contrast is not striking&mdash;only there is no
organisation outside.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went down a black cindery road between high
walls and presently the guide said quietly, &#8220;Are you
coming here to us, Mr. Aston?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Christopher&#8217;s voice was fervent with
thankfulness.</p>
<p>The other looked disappointed and stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We thought you were.
There were rumours&#8221;&mdash;he hesitated, &#8220;if you are not
coming perhaps it is no good showing you. It makes
a difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to see where the people live,&#8221; insisted
Christopher, looking him squarely in the face.</p>
<p>The other nodded and they went on and came to a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
narrow street of mean, two-storied houses, with
cracked walls and warped door-posts, blackened with
smoke, begrimed with dirt. As much of the spring
sunshine as struggled through the haze overshadowing
the place served but to emphasise the hideous
squalor of it. Children, for the most part sturdy-limbed
and well-developed, swarmed in the road,
women in a more or less dishevelled condition stared
out of open doors at them as they passed.</p>
<p>To the secret surprise of Fulner his companion made
no remark, betrayed no sign of disgust or distaste.
He looked at it all; his face was grave and impassive
and Fulner was again disappointed.</p>
<p>They passed a glaring new public house, the only
spot in the neighbourhood where the sun could find
anything to reflect his clouded brightness.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted that corner for a club,&#8221; said Fulner
bitterly, &#8220;but the brewer outbid us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s the landlord?&#8221; demanded Christopher
sharply.</p>
<p>Fulner paused a moment before he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a cousin of Mr. Masters, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No relation at all. Is he the landlord?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The land here is all his. Not what is on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A woman was coming down the road, a woman in a
bright green dress with a dirty lace blouse fastened
with a gold brooch. She had turquoise earrings in
her ears and rings on her fingers.</p>
<p>She stopped Fulner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Fulner,&#8221; she said in a quavering voice, &#8220;they
say the master&#8217;s at the works and that Scott&#8217;s given
Jim away to save his own skin. It isn&#8217;t true, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Fulner looked at her with pity. Christopher liked
him better than ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s true, Mrs. Lawrie, but Scott
couldn&#8217;t help himself. Mr. Masters spotted the game
when we were in the big engine-room. You go down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
to the main gate and wait for Jim. Perhaps you&#8217;ll
get him home safe if you take him the short cut, not
this way.&#8221; He nodded his head towards the public
house they had passed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame,&#8221; broke out the woman wildly, but
her sentences were overlaid with unwomanly words,
&#8220;they all does it. I ask now, how&#8217;s we to get coal at
all if we don&#8217;t get the leavings. Jim only does what
they all does. What&#8217;s &#8217;arf a pail of coal to &#8217;im? I&#8217;d
like to talk to &#8217;un, I would. Jim will go mad again,
and I&#8217;ve three of &#8217;un now to think of, the brats.&#8221; She
flung up her arms with a superbly helpless gesture
and stumbled off down the road.</p>
<p>Christopher looked after her with a white face.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it mean?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The men have a way of appropriating the remains
of the last measure of coal they put on before going
off duty. It&#8217;s wrong of course: it&#8217;s been going on for
ages. I warned Scott&mdash;he&#8217;s the foreman. They&#8217;ve
been complaining about the coal supply at headquarters.
Mr. Masters caught Jim Lawrie at it to-day as
we left the big engine-room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it a first offence?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no first offence here,&#8221; returned Fulner
grimly. &#8220;There&#8217;s one only. There&#8217;s the club room.
We have to pay &pound;20 a year rent for the ground and
then to keep it going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But surely, Mr. Masters&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; began Christopher
and stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Masters has nothing to do with the place
outside the works. It is not part of the System. He
pays 6d. a head more than any other employer and
that frees him. There&#8217;s the station.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused as if he would leave his companion to
make his way on alone. He was obviously dissatisfied
and uneasy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come to the station with me?&#8221; Christopher
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
asked, and as they walked he began to speak
slowly and hesitatingly, as one who must choose from
words that were on the verge of overflowing. &#8220;I
was brought up in Lambeth, Mr. Fulner. I am used
to poverty and bad sights. Don&#8217;t go on thinking I
don&#8217;t care. These people earn fortunes beside those
I have known, but in all London I&#8217;ve never seen anything
so horrible as this, nothing so hideous, sordid&mdash;&#8221; he
stopped with a gasp, &#8220;the women&mdash;the children&mdash;the
lost desire&mdash;the ugliness.&#8221;</p>
<p>They walked on silently. Presently he spoke again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a plucky man, Mr. Fulner. I couldn&#8217;t
face it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no choice. I don&#8217;t know why I showed you
it, except I thought you were coming and I wanted
your help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are there many who care?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. It&#8217;s too precarious. Mr. Masters doesn&#8217;t
approve of fools. Mind you, the men have no grievances
inside the works. The unions have no chance
now. It&#8217;s fair to remember that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it the same everywhere?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The System&#8217;s the same. I know nothing about
the other works but that. There&#8217;s the train: we must
hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want for your club?&#8221; Christopher
asked as he entered his carriage.</p>
<p>&#8220;A billiard table, gym fittings, books. We&#8217;ve a
license. We sell beer to members,&#8221; his eyes were
eager: the man&#8217;s heart was in his hopeless self-imposed
work.</p>
<p>Christopher nodded. &#8220;I shall not forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they parted: each wondering over the other&mdash;would
have wondered still more if they had known in
what relationship they would stand to each other when
they next met.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>
<p>Christopher stood for a moment inside the great
hall at Stormly Park and looked round. It was quite
beautiful. Peter Masters, having chosen the best man
in England for his purpose, had had the sense to let
him alone. There was no discordant note anywhere
and Christopher was quite alive to its perfections. But
coming straight from Stormly Town the contrast was
too glaring and too crude. It was not that Peter
Masters was rich and his people were poor. Poverty
and riches have run hand in hand down the generations
of men, but here, the people were poor in all
things, in morals, in desire, in beauty, in all that lifted
them in the scale of humanity, in order that he, Peter
Masters, should be superfluously rich, outrageously
so!</p>
<p>Christopher struggled hard to be just: he knew it
was not the superfluous money that was grudged, it
was the more precious time and thought saved with
a greed that was worse than the hunger of a miser&mdash;for
no purpose but to add to over-filled stores.
He knew all Peter Masters&#8217; arguments in defence
of his System already: That he compelled no man to
serve him, that none did so except on a clear understanding
of the terms; that for the hours they toiled
for him he paid highly, and his responsibility ceased
when those hours were over. If Peter Masters was
no philanthropist at least he was no humbug. He said
openly he worked his System because it paid him. If
he could have made more by being philanthropical he
would have been so, but he would not have called it
philanthropy: it would have been a financial method.</p>
<p>The grim selfishness of it all crushed Christopher as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
an intolerable burden that was none of his, and yet,
because he was here accepting a part of its results, he
could not clear himself of its shadow. So, twenty-two
years ago, had his mother thought until the terror
of that shadow outweighed all dread of further evil,
and she had fled from its shade into a world where
sun and shadow were checkered and evil and good a
twisted rope by which to hold.</p>
<p>Some dim note from that long struggle and momentous
decision had its influence with her son now.
Without knowing it he was hastening to the same
conclusions she had reached.</p>
<p>He lunched alone and then to escape the persistence
of his thoughts decided to explore the west wing of
the house which he had hardly entered.</p>
<p>At the end of a long corridor a square of yellow
sunlight fell across the purple carpet from an open
door and he stopped to look in.</p>
<p>It was a pretty room with three windows opening
on to a terrace and a door communicating with a room
beyond. The walls were panelled with pale blue silk
and the chairs and luxurious couches covered with the
same. There were several pictures of great value,
on a French writing table lay an open blotter, but the
blotting paper was crumbling and dry and the ink in
the carved brass inkstand was dry also.</p>
<p>In the middle of the room surrounded by a pile of
Holland covers and hangings stood Mrs. Eliot, the
housekeeper. Christopher had seen her once or twice
and she was the only servant, except the butler, with
whom he had heard Peter Masters exchange a word.
&#8220;Lor&#8217;, sir, how you made me jump!&#8221; she cried at
sight of him in the doorway. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t often one
hears a footfall down here, they girls keep away or
I&#8217;d be about &#8217;em as they know very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May I come in?&#8221; asked Christopher. &#8220;What a
pretty room.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>The woman glanced round hesitatingly. &#8220;Well,
now, you&#8217;re here. Yes. It&#8217;s pretty enough, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you getting ready for visitors?&#8221;</p>
<p>He had no intention of being curious, he was only
thankful to find some distraction from his own
thoughts, and there seemed no reason why he should
not chat to the kindly portly lady in charge.</p>
<p>&#8220;No visitors here, sir. We don&#8217;t have much company.
Just a gentleman now and then, as may be
yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>She pulled a light pair of steps to the window and
mounted them cautiously one step at a time, dragging
a long Holland curtain in her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to hang that up?&#8221; asked Christopher,
watching her with idle interest. &#8220;Do let me
do it, Mrs. Eliot, you&#8217;ll fall off those steps if you go
higher. I can&#8217;t promise to catch you, but I can
promise to hang curtains much better than you can.&#8221;
Mrs. Eliot, who was already panting with exertion
and the fatigue of stretching up her ample figure to
unaccustomed heights, looked down at him doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever would Mr. Masters say, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He would be quite pleased his visitor found so
harmless an amusement. You come down, Mrs.
Eliot. Curtain-hanging is a passion with me, but
what a shame to cover up those pretty curtains with
dingy Holland!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t be pretty curtains now, sir,&#8221; said
Mrs. Eliot, descending with elaborate care, &#8220;if they
hadn&#8217;t been covered up these twenty years and more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a waste,&#8221; ejaculated Christopher now on
the steps, &#8220;isn&#8217;t the room ever used?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never since Mrs. Masters went out of
<ins class="trnote" title="Transcriber&amp;#8217;s Note: removed extra double quote mark">it.</ins>
&#8216;Eliot,&#8217; says the master&mdash;I was first housemaid then&mdash;&#8216;keep
Mrs. Masters&#8217; rooms just as they are, ready
for use. She will want them again some day.&#8217; So
I did.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>Christopher shifted the steps and hung another
curtain.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know there had been a Mrs. Masters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most folk have forgotten it, I think, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This was her boudoir, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And I think he&#8217;s never been in here since
she went, but once, and that was five years after.
The boudoir bell rang and I came, all of a tremble,
to hear it for the first time after so long. He was
standing as it may be there. &#8216;That cushion&#8217;s faded,
Eliot,&#8217; he said, &#8216;get another made like it. You are
to replace everything that gets torn or faded or worn
without troubling me. Keep the rooms just as they
are.&#8217; He had a pile of photographs in his hand and
a little picture, and he locked them up in that cabinet,
and I don&#8217;t suppose it&#8217;s been opened since. He never
made any fuss about it from the first. No, nor altered
his ways either.&#8221; She drew a cover over a chair and
tied the strings viciously. &#8220;It&#8217;s for all the world as if
he&#8217;d never had a wife at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher had hung the three sets of curtains
now and he sat on the top step and looked
round the room curiously. It was less oppressively
modern that the rest of the house and he had an idea
the master of Stormly was not responsible for that.
He felt a vivid interest in the late Mrs. Masters,
Why had she gone and why had neither Aymer nor
St. Michael mentioned her existence? He longed to
override his own sense of etiquette and question Mrs.
Eliot, who continued to ramble on in her own way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I takes off the coverings every two months, and
brushes it all down myself,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve
never had anyone to help me before. If I were to
let them girls in they&#8217;d break every vase in the place
with their frills and their &#8216;didn&#8217;t see&#8217;s.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do those sheets hang over the panels?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t think of troubling you! But if you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
will, sir, why then, that&#8217;s the sheet for there. They
are all numbered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher covered up the dainty walls regretfully.
Why had she left it? Had she and Peter
quarrelled? It seemed to Christopher, in his present
mood towards Mr. Masters, they might well have
done so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember Mrs. Masters?&#8221; he was
tempted to ask presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I do, seeing I was here when he brought
her home. Tall, thin, and like a queen the way she
walked, a great lady, for all she was simple enough
by birth, they say. But she went, and where she went
none of us know to this day, and some say the Master
doesn&#8217;t either, but I don&#8217;t think it myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher straightened a pen and ink sketch of a
workman on the wall. It was a clever piece of work,
life-like and sympathetic.</p>
<p>&#8220;She did that,&#8221; said Mrs. Eliot with a proprietor&#8217;s
pride. &#8220;She was considered clever that way, I&#8217;ve
been told. That&#8217;s another of hers on the easel over
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher examined it and gave a gasp. It was
a bold sketch of two men playing cards at a table with
a lamp behind them. The expression on the players&#8217;
faces was defined and forcible, but it was not their
artistic merit that startled him, but their identity.
One&mdash;the tolerant winner&mdash;was Peter himself&mdash;the
other&mdash;the easy loser&mdash;was Aymer Aston.</p>
<p>So Aymer did know of Mrs. Masters&#8217; existence,
knew her well enough for her to make this intimate
likeness of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it done here?&#8221; he asked slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, she brought it with her. I don&#8217;t know who
the other gentleman is, but it&#8217;s a beautiful picture of
the master, isn&#8217;t it? so life-like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>He looked again round the room, fighting again
with his desire to search for more traces of its late
owner, and then grew hot with shame at his curiosity.
He left Mrs. Eliot rather abruptly and wandered out
of the house, but the unknown mistress of the place
haunted him, glided before him across the smooth
lawns, he could almost hear the rustle of her dress on
the gravel, and then recollected with relief it was
only the memory of the old game he used to play at
Aston House with his dead mother, transferred by
some mental suggestion to Stormly Park. Presently
he saw the bulky form of Peter Masters on the steps
and joined him reluctantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to see you, Christopher,&#8221; said Peter as
he approached. &#8220;Come into my room. I shan&#8217;t be
able to go to London this week to buy the car,
so you must stay until Monday and go up
with me then,&#8221; he announced, and without waiting
for assent or protest plunged into his subject with
calculated abruptness.</p>
<p>&#8220;This road business of yours, is there money
in it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so. It is not done yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long will it take you to perfect it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I tell? It may mean weeks, it may
mean months.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do when you&#8217;ve found
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get someone to take it up, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher was answering against his will, but
the swift sharp questions left him no time to fence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take it up now. Fit you up a laboratory and
experimenting ground and give you two years to perfect
it&mdash;and a partnership when it&#8217;s started.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher looked up with incredulous amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s a purely scientific speculation at present.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
There are just about half a dozen people on the track.
We are all racing each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve got to win, and I&#8217;ll back you. You
shall have every assistance you want&mdash;money shan&#8217;t
count. You can live here and have the North Park
for trials, as many men as you want and no interruption.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s impossible. It&#8217;s not a certainty even.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No speculation is a certainty. If you bring it off
it will mean a fortune, properly managed. I can
do that for you far better than Aymer. We should
share profits, of course, and I should have to risk
money. It&#8217;s a fancy thing, but it pleases me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher got up and went to the open window.
The tussle between them had come. It would need
all his strength to keep himself free from this man&#8217;s
toils. However generous in appearance, Christopher
knew they were toils for him, and must be avoided.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aymer&#8217;s done well enough for you so far,&#8221; pursued
Peter Masters from the depths of his chair.
&#8220;We will grant him all credit, but this is the affair
of a business man: it requires capital: it requires
business knowledge: and it requires faith. You will
have to go to someone if you don&#8217;t come to me, and
I&#8217;m making you a better offer than you&#8217;ll get elsewhere.
I&#8217;ll do more. We&#8217;ll buy up the other men if
they are dangerous. You can have their experience,
too. It&#8217;s only a question of investing enough
money.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he stood there in the window Christopher realised
it all: how near his darling project lay to his
heart, how great and harassing would be the difficulties
of launching it on the world; how sure success
would be under this man&#8217;s guidance, and yet how with
all his heart and soul and unreasoning mind he hated
the thought of it, and would have found life itself
dear at the purchase of his freedom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>His hands shook a little as he turned, but his voice
was quiet and steady.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very generous of you, sir, but I could not
possibly pledge myself to you or any man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m asking no pledge. I&#8217;m only asking you to
complete your own invention, and when it&#8217;s completed
I&#8217;ll help you to use it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must be free.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You own you can&#8217;t use any discovery by yourself,
you&#8217;d have to go to someone. I come to you.
The credit will be yours. I only find the means and
share the return&mdash;fair interest on capital.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what? Do you doubt my financial ability
or financial soundness?&#8221;</p>
<p>The meshes of the net were very narrow. Christopher
sat with his head on his hands. He could
waste no force in inventing reasons, neither could
he explain the intangible truth. It was a fight of
wills solely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do it,&#8221; said Christopher doggedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are only a boy, but I credit you with more
common-sense and a better eye for business than
many young men double your age. What displeases
you in my offer? Where do you want it altered?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want it at all, Mr. Masters. I won&#8217;t
accept it. I don&#8217;t think my reason matters at all.
I know I shall never do so well, but I refuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are others who would take it. Suppose
you are forestalled?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher looked him straight in the eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fair fight so far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A fight is always fair to the winner,&#8221; returned
Masters grimly. There was a silence. The next
thrust reached the heart of the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your objection to dealing with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter Masters leant forward as he spoke and put a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
finger on the other&#8217;s knee; his hard, keen eyes sought
the far recesses of his son&#8217;s mind, but they did not
sink deep enough to read his soul. Christopher struggled
with the impetuous words, the direct bare truth
that sought for utterance. Truth was too pure and
subtle a thing to give back here. When he answered
it was in his old deliberate manner, as he had answered
Fulner&mdash;as he would invariably answer when
he mistrusted his own judgment.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I told you my objections you would not care
for them or understand them. You would think
them folly. I won&#8217;t defend them. I won&#8217;t offer
them. It is just impossible, but I thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose and Masters did the same with a curious
look of admiration and disappointment in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you a better business man, Christopher.
Will you refer the matter to your&mdash;guardian?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. It is quite my own. Even Aymer can&#8217;t
help me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter&#8217;s lips straightened ominously.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will come to me yet. My terms will not be so
good again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I am at least warned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As you will. You are a fool, Christopher, perhaps
I am well quit of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that is quite likely,&#8221; returned Christopher
gravely, with a faint twinkle of amusement in his
eyes. He went away despondently, however, and
stopped at the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;When would you like me to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you: we go up to London on Monday,&#8221;
said the millionaire sharply. &#8220;I engaged you to buy
a car and you must buy it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am quite ready to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>He left the room with an appalling sense of defeat
and humiliation on him. He could hardly credit a
victory that left him so bruised and spiritless. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
was in his mind to run away and avoid his engagement
in London. He might even have done so but
for Peter&#8217;s remark. He walked across the hall with
downcast eyes and nearly fell against a tall thin form.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevil!&#8221; cried Christopher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Nevil. Christopher, could I be had up for
libel if I wrote the life of a railway train?&#8221;</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>
<p>Christopher led the way into the nearest room and
turned to Nevil with an anxious face.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is wrong? Is it C&aelig;sar?&#8221; He stopped
abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing wrong. Mayn&#8217;t anyone leave
Marden but you, you young autocrat?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil deposited his lanky self in a comfortable
chair and smiled in his slow way. Then he looked
round the room with a critical, disapproving eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Peter at home?&#8221; he asked, &#8220;and do you think
he could put me up for a night? I suppose I ought
to see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher did not offer to move.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shan&#8217;t see him till you tell me what brings
you here, Nevil,&#8221; he said firmly.</p>
<p>The other shook his head. &#8220;That&#8217;s a bad argument,
Christopher. However, I&#8217;ll pretend it&#8217;s effectual.
There&#8217;s a man at Leamington who has some
records he considers priceless, but which I think are
frauds. I thought if I came up to-day I could travel
down with you to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>It sounded plausible&mdash;too plausible when Christopher
considered the difficulty it was to rouse Nevil
even to go to London. There might be a man in
Leamington, but he didn&#8217;t believe Nevil had come
to see him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are growing very energetic, Nevil,&#8221; he
said slowly, &#8220;all this trouble over some fraudulent
records.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They might be genuine, and really important,&#8221;
Nevil suggested cautiously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>&#8220;At all events I was not returning till Saturday,
and Mr. Masters wants me to stay till Monday now,
and go to London with him then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil crossed and uncrossed his long legs, gazing
abstractedly at a modern picture of medi&aelig;val warfare.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those helmets are fifteen years too late for that
battle,&#8221; he volunteered, &#8220;and the pikes are German,
not French. What a rotten picture. Don&#8217;t you think
you could come back with me? I hate travelling
alone. I always believe I shall get mislaid and be
taken to the Lost Property Office. Porters are so
careless.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not look round, but continued to examine
the details of the offending picture.</p>
<p>Christopher leant over his chair and put his hands
on Nevil&#8217;s shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevil, I can&#8217;t stand any more. Tell me why I
am to come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other looked up at him with a rueful little
smile, singularly like his father&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were not always so dense, Christopher. I
hoped you wouldn&#8217;t ask questions that are too difficult
to answer. To begin with, neither my father nor
Aymer know I&#8217;ve come. They think I&#8217;m in town.
You see, C&aelig;sar misses you, though he wouldn&#8217;t have
you think so for the world, in case it added to your
natural conceit, but it makes him&mdash;cross, yes, rather
particularly cross and that upsets the house. I can&#8217;t
write at all, so I thought you had better come back.
The fact is,&#8221; he added with a burst of confidence,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve promised an article on the Masterpieces of
Freedom for August. I seldom promise, but I like
to keep my word if I do, and it&#8217;s impossible to
write now. If you&#8217;re enjoying yourself it&#8217;s horribly
selfish&mdash;but you see the importance of it, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; allowed Christopher with the ghost of a
smile, &#8220;it&#8217;s lamentably selfish of you, but I realise
the importance. Shall we go by rail to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Leamington?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will the man run away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father might have been interested to see the
papers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You dear old fraud,&#8221; said Christopher with an
odd little catch in his voice, &#8220;do you suppose St.
Michael won&#8217;t see through you? Is it like you to
travel this distance to see doubtful records when you
won&#8217;t go to London to see genuine ones? Why did
not St. Michael write to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;C&aelig;sar would not let him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must be ill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is not, on my word, Christopher. He is just
worried to the verge of distraction by your being here.
It seems ridiculous, but so it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you write yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil considered the question gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t I write? Oh, I know. I only
thought of it this morning and it seemed quicker to
come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or wire?&#8221; persisted Christopher.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would have cost such a lot to explain,&#8221; he answered
candidly. &#8220;I did think of that and started
to send one. Then I found I had only twopence in
my pocket. If I had sent anyone else to the office
everyone would have known I was sending for you
and C&aelig;sar would have been more annoyed than
ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I quite see. What did Mrs. Aston say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think she said you&#8217;d be sure to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher nodded. &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll go by mail to-night.&#8221;
Then he shut his teeth sharply and looked
out of the window with a frown, thinking of the
renewed battle of wills to come, and at last said he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
would go and find Mr. Masters, since no one appeared
to have told him of Nevil&#8217;s arrival.</p>
<p>He went straight down the corridor to Peter Masters&#8217;
room. The owner was still seated as he had
left him, smoking placidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Changed your mind already?&#8221; he asked as his
guest entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not that, but Nevil Aston has come and I
must go back with him by the mail to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; The big man sprang to his feet.
&#8220;Is Aymer ill?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no. I don&#8217;t think so. It may be Nevil&#8217;s
fancy. He thinks Aymer wants me back. Of course
it sounds absurd, but Nevil, who won&#8217;t stir beyond
the garden on his own account, has come all this way
to fetch me to C&aelig;sar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter Masters was half-way to the door and tossed
a question over his shoulder curtly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the little reception-room.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher followed him down the passage puzzling
over this unexpected behaviour.</p>
<p>Nevil was re-exploring the inaccurate picture with
patient sorrow and despair. He hardly turned as
they entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, Peter,&#8221; he said unenthusiastically,
&#8220;why do you buy pictures like that by men
who don&#8217;t even know the subject they are painting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll burn it to-morrow. What&#8217;s the matter with
Aymer, Nevil?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil looked reproachfully at Christopher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing is the matter, as I told Christopher,
only I&#8217;d a man to see at Leamington and thought I
could get a fellow victim here for the journey home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll meet you in London on Monday,&#8221; put in the
fellow victim quietly to Mr. Masters.</p>
<p>Peter looked from one to the other, lastly he looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
long at Christopher and Christopher looked at him.
Nothing short of the revelation Peter was as yet unprepared
to make would stop Christopher from going
to Aymer Aston that night he knew, and if he let the
boy go back with the truth untold, it would be forever
untold&mdash;by <i>him</i>. That it <i>was</i> the Truth was a
conviction now. There was no space left for a shadow
of mistrust in his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you go by the mail we&#8217;d better dine at eight
sharp,&#8221; he said abruptly. &#8220;I want to see you, Christopher,
before you go, in my room.&#8221; He turned towards
the door, adding as an afterthought, &#8220;You
must look after Nevil till I am free.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil gave a gentle sigh of satisfaction as the door
closed.</p>
<p>Christopher laughed. The relief was so unexpected,
so astounding. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have some tea in the
orangery,&#8221; he said after a moment&#8217;s consideration.
&#8220;You may not like the statuary, but the orange trees
at least offer no anachronisms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter Masters shut the door of his room with a
bang and going to an ever-ready tray, helped himself
to a whiskey and soda with a free hand. Then he
carefully selected a cigar of a brand he kept for the
Smoke of Great Decisions, and lit it. All this he did
mechanically, by force of habit, but after it was done,
habit found no path for itself, for Peter Masters was
treading new roads, wandering in unaccustomed
regions, and found no solution to his problem in the
ancient ways.</p>
<p>Was he, who for thirty-five years of life&mdash;from full
manhood till now&mdash;had never consulted any will or
pleasure but his own&mdash;was he now going to make a supreme
denial to himself for no better reason than
the easing of a stricken man&#8217;s burden?</p>
<p>The man once had been his friend, but the boy
was his. And he wanted him. He clenched his fist
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
on the thought. He was perfectly aware of his own
will in this matter.</p>
<p>Even from the material or business point of view
his need of a son and heir had grown great of late.
He had never contemplated the non-existence of one,
just as he had never contemplated the non-existence
of Elizabeth. He had counted, it is true, on overpowering
the alert senses of one who had known the
pinch of poverty with superabundant evidence of the
fortune that was his. He had noted the havoc
wrought to great fortunes by children brought up
to regard great wealth as the natural standard of
life; he meant to avoid that error, and in the unnatural
neglect of the boy he had believed to be his,
there was less callous indifference than Charles Aston
thought: it was more the outcome of a crooked reasoning
which placed the ultimate good of his fortune
above the immediate well-being of his child. The terrible
event in Liverpool that had shattered his almost
childish belief in his wife&#8217;s existence had also wiped
away her fading image from his mind. The whole
force of his energetic nature was focussed on the
possible personality of his son. This Christopher of
Aymer Aston&#8217;s upbringing, entirely different from
all he had purposed to find in his heir, called to him
across forgotten waters. His very obstinacy and will
power were matters in which Peter rejoiced&mdash;they
were qualities no Aston had implanted. He was
proud of his son and his pride clamoured to possess
in entirety what was his by right of man.</p>
<p>What could prevent him? He sat biting his fingertips
and frowning into the gathering twilight without&mdash;at
that persistent vision of Aymer Aston&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>There were plenty of men in the world who would
have shrugged their shoulders over the question of
Peter Masters&#8217; honesty, some who would have accredited
his lightest word and yet would have preferred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
a legal buffer between them and the bargain
he drove: many who considered him a model of financial
honesty. It was a matter of the personal standpoint:
perhaps none of them would have troubled to
measure the millionaire by any measure than their
own. Peter&#8217;s own measure was of primitive simplicity&mdash;he
never took something for nothing, and if
he placed his own value on what he bought and what
he paid, he at least believed in his own scale of prices.
Had he picked up a banknote in the street he would
have lodged it with the police unless he considered
the amount only equalised his trouble in stopping to
rescue it. Had his son dragged himself up the toilsome
ladder to manhood (he ignored the possibility
of woman&#8217;s aid), he would have taken him as he was,
good or bad, without compunction, but he recognised
that Christopher was not the outcome of his own
efforts only, that Aymer having expended the unpriceable
capital of time, patience and love, might,
with all reason, according to Peter Masters&#8217; code of
life, look for the full return of sole possession in the
result. Was he, then, in the face of his own standard
of honest dealing, going to rob Aymer of the fruit of
his labours, to take so great a something for nothing?</p>
<p>Let it be to Peter&#8217;s everlasting credit that he knew
his millions to be as inadequate to offer a return as
any beggar&#8217;s pocket. He had no quarrel with himself
over his past conduct, he repudiated nothing and regretted
nothing, he merely viewed the question from
the immediate standpoint of the present. Was he going
to violate the one rule of his life or not? He
made no pretence about it. If he claimed his son he
would claim him entirely. Christopher would refuse,
would resist the claim at first&mdash;of that Peter was assured.
But it would be Aymer himself who would
fight with time on his side and insist on Peter&#8217;s rights,
he was equally assured of that. But still Christopher
would refuse.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></p>
<p>Peter Masters got up and began to walk up and
down and parcelled out bribes.</p>
<p>&#8220;He shall have the Foundry to play with&mdash;a garden
city for them if he likes. His own affair run on
his own silly lines.&#8221; So he thought, ready to sweep
to oblivion rule and system for the possession of this
son of his.</p>
<p>But there remained Aymer.</p>
<p>Whether he gained Christopher in the end or not
the very making of the claim would make a break
between Aymer and his adopted son,&mdash;a gulf over
which they would stretch out hands and never meet.</p>
<p>Aymer loved him. Aymer of the maimed life, the
shattered hopes, whose destiny filled Peter with sick
pity even now, so that he stretched out his great arms
and moved sharply with a dumb thankfulness to something
that he could move.</p>
<p>He might as well rob a child&mdash;or a beggar&mdash;better:
he could give them a possible equivalent.</p>
<p>He went slowly to the side table and had a second
whiskey and soda, mechanically as he had done at first,
then he rang the bell.</p>
<p>When Christopher sought him shortly before dinner-time
he was told curtly he could go to London at
his leisure and purchase a car where and how he liked,
so it were a good one.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall want a chauffeur with it,&#8221; he added, &#8220;English,
mind. You can charge your expenses with your
commission, whatever that is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher said gravely he would consider the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can send me word how Aymer is,&#8221; concluded
Masters shortly. &#8220;I suppose he&#8217;s ill. The whole lot
of you spoil him outrageously.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>
<p>Perhaps they did spoil Aymer Aston, these good people,
who loved him so greatly, setting so high a store
upon his happiness that their own well-being was
merged therein.</p>
<p>While it was quite true that neither Nevil nor any
other could have worked peacefully in the electrical
atmosphere of the house after Christopher left with
Peter Masters, it is also true that no temporary personal
inconvenience would have driven Nevil to undertake
the long and tiresome journey, if his brother&#8217;s
welfare had not been involved.</p>
<p>The need had been great. Aymer&#8217;s restless misery
increased every day of Christopher&#8217;s absence. He refused
to see any of the household but his father and
Vespasian, and though at first he made desperate efforts
to control himself, in the end he gave up, and
long hours of sullen brooding silence were interposed
with passionate flashes of temper. It was the old days
over again, and all those near him realised to the full
how great was the victory that had been won and how
terrible life might have been for them all without it.
Therefore they were very patient and tolerant, though
Mr. Aston began to consider seriously if he would not
be justified in breaking his given word to Aymer and
summoning Christopher back at once.</p>
<p>He looked very worn and tired when he joined
<ins class="trnote" title="Transcriber&amp;#8217;s Note: Renate in original text">Renata</ins> at dinner on the Thursday night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevil does not mean to be away long, does he?&#8221;
he inquired anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I think not. Why, St. Michael? Does C&aelig;sar
want him?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He asked for him this evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a pity.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went on with her soup, with a little rose of
colour on her face, thinking of the secret her husband
had of course confided to her. Presently observing
St. Michael hardly touched his dinner and seemed too
weary to talk, she suggested nervously that she should
sit with Aymer that evening. He conjured up a kind
smile of thanks, but refused in his gentle, courteous
way, saying that Aymer seemed disinclined to talk.</p>
<p>When Mr. Aston went back to the West Room a
little later, that disinclination seemed to have evaporated.
He heard C&aelig;sar&#8217;s furious voice pouring a cascade
of biting words on someone as he opened the
door. Vespasian was the unfortunate occasion and
the unwilling victim; Vespasian, who was older by
twenty years than in the days when he stood unmoved
before continuous and worse storms. His usually impassive
face was rather red and he now and then uttered
a dignified protest and finally bent to pick up the
shattered glass that lay between them and was the
original cause of the trouble. Aymer, with renewed
invective, clutched a book to hurl at the unfortunate
man, but before he could fling it, Mr. Aston leant
over the head of the sofa and seized his wrists. The
left would have been powerless in a child&#8217;s grasp and
the elder man&#8217;s position made him master of the still
strong right arm.</p>
<p>At a faint sign from Mr. Aston, Vespasian vanished.</p>
<p>Aymer made one unavailing attempt to free himself
as his father drew his hands up level with his head.
He tried not to look at the face leaning over him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aymer,&#8221; said his father, with great tenderness,
&#8220;do you remember what I used to do with you when
you were a little boy and lost your temper?&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer gave a short, uneasy laugh. &#8220;Tie my hands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
to a chair or a bed head. It was all right then, it is
taking a mean advantage now.&#8221; He ended with a
choking laugh again, and Mr. Aston felt his hands
tremble under his careful grasp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aymer, my dear old fellow, if you must turn on
someone, then turn on me. I understand how it is.
Vespasian doesn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s not fair. It&#8217;s the way of a
fractious invalid, not of a sane man. Where&#8217;s your
pride?&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer bit his lip. He was helpless and humiliated,
but after all it was his father. He looked up at him
at last with a crooked smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve none&mdash;in your power like this, sir. Let me
go, I&#8217;ll be a good boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>They both laughed, and Mr. Aston released him.
The colour burned on Aymer&#8217;s face. Grown man as
he was, the sudden subjection to authority so exerted
was hard to bear even in the half-joking aspect with
which his father covered it.</p>
<p>Mr. Aston knew it. He had deliberately used the
very helplessness that was his son&#8217;s best excuse for his
outbreak, to check the same, and however thankful for
his success, the means were bitter to him also, only he
was not going to let Aymer see it or get off without
further word.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall have to send you to school again,&#8221; he said,
picking up the broken glass. &#8220;I can&#8217;t have Nevil&#8217;s
property treated like this. He&#8217;ll be adding &#8216;breakages&#8217;
to the weekly bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pay,&#8221; pleaded Aymer, contritely, &#8220;if you
won&#8217;t tell him. Where is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone to London, of all the preposterous things; so
Renata says. She expects him back to-morrow, I
suppose Bowden will look after him, but I should have
wired to them had I known he was going.&#8221;</p>
<p>He seemed really a little worried, and Aymer
laughed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What a family, St. Michael! Nevil can look after
himself a good deal better than you think. He puts
it on to get more attention.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think he is jealous?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not an ounce of it in him. I have the monopoly
of that,&#8221; he added, with a sharp sigh, and then, without
any warning, he caught his father&#8217;s arm and pulled
him near.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; his voice was hoarse and unsteady, &#8220;if
Peter tells Christopher, what will happen? I can&#8217;t
think it out steadily. I can&#8217;t face it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Aston knelt by him and put his hand on his
shoulder, concealing his own distress at this unheard-of
breakdown.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear boy, it would not make the slightest difference
to Christopher. I&#8217;m seriously afraid he&#8217;d tell
Peter to go to the devil&mdash;and he&#8217;d come home by the
next train. He&#8217;d never accept him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d never forget,&#8221; persisted Aymer, the sleeping
agony of long years shining in his eyes. &#8220;It would
not be the same, father. He would not be&mdash;mine. I
could not pretend it if he knew. Peter would be
there between us&mdash;always as he was&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off and took up the thread with a still
sharper note of pain, &#8220;Father, can&#8217;t you understand.
I don&#8217;t mind a woman. He&#8217;ll love and marry some
day: it&#8217;s his right. I don&#8217;t grudge that. But another
father&mdash;his real one. Oh, My God, mayn&#8217;t I keep
even this for myself?&#8221; He hid his face on the cushions,
all the wild jealousy of his nature struggling
with his pride.</p>
<p>His father put his arm round him, hardly able to
credit the meaning of the crisis. Was that white scar
on his son&#8217;s forehead no memorial to a dead jealousy,
but only an expression of a slumbering passion?</p>
<p>&#8220;Aymer, old fellow, listen. Peter isn&#8217;t going to
tell, I feel sure of it. And it would make no difference.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
You must allow I know something of men. I
give you my word of honour, Aymer, I know it would
make no difference to Christopher. You wrong him.
You will always be first with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not Christopher,&#8221; returned Aymer, lifting
hard, haggard eyes to his father, &#8220;it&#8217;s myself. Twice
in my life I&#8217;ve wanted something&mdash;someone for myself
alone. Elizabeth&mdash;and now Christopher! It&#8217;s I
who can&#8217;t share.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jealousy, cruel as the grave.&#8221; Involuntarily the
words escaped Mr. Aston.</p>
<p>&#8220;More cruel.&#8221;</p>
<p>He dropped his head again. St. Michael continued
to kneel by him in silence. The elementary forces of
nature are hard matters with which to deal. Silence,
sympathy, and the loan of mental strength were all
he could offer.</p>
<p>It came to his mind in the quiet stillness how in just
such a crisis as this, when he was not at hand to help
the same cruel passion had wrought the irrevocable
havoc with his son&#8217;s life. He looked at the dark head
pressed on the pillows and remembered his young
wife&#8217;s half-laughing pride in her first-born&#8217;s copper
coloured aureole of hair. He recollected the day he
had first held him in his arms, himself but just arrived
at man&#8217;s estate, and this helpless little baby given
into his power and keeping. He had done his best:
God knows how humbly he confessed that more than
truthful Truth, yet even all his love had failed to save
that little red-haired baby from this ... jealousy,
cruel as the grave! Perhaps he had been too young a
father to deal with it at first. Was it his failure or
were there greater forces behind&mdash;the forces of ages
of other failures for which poor Aymer paid....</p>
<p>Aymer moved till his head rested against his
father&#8217;s arm, like a tired child. Presently he looked
up rather shamefacedly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s over. What a fool I&#8217;ve been. Don&#8217;t tell
Christopher, father.&#8221;</p>
<p>A faint reflection of what Aymer considered his own
terrible monopoly, caught poor St. Michael for a fleeting
moment, a jealous pang that his son&#8217;s first thought
must go to the boy. He realised suddenly he was
tired out and old, and got to his feet stiffly.</p>
<p>Aymer gave him a quick, penetrating glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Send Vespasian back, father,&#8221; he said abruptly,
&#8220;and you go to bed. What a selfish brute I&#8217;ve been.&#8221;
And when Mr. Aston had bidden him good-night he
added in the indifferent tone in which he veiled any
great effort, &#8220;If Peter should want Christopher to
stay longer, you might tell him to come back&mdash;it
doesn&#8217;t pay to be so proud&mdash;and I&#8217;ll apologise to Vespasian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s worth it,&#8221; said Mr. Aston with a smile, &#8220;he
and I are getting old, Aymer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Negatived by a large majority, sir,&#8221; he answered
quickly.</p>
<p>It was not of Christopher he thought in the silent
hours of the night, and Mr. Aston&#8217;s brief jealousy
would have found no food on which to thrive had it
survived its momentary existence.</p>
<p>When Mr. Aston came down in the morning the
first sight that met his astonished eyes was Christopher,
seated at the breakfast table and attacking that
meal with liberal energy. He sprang up as Mr. Aston
entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear boy, I thought you were not coming till
to-morrow at the earliest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will it be inconvenient?&#8221; asked Christopher, with
demure gravity. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but I was so bored.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stumbled a little over the prevarication. St.
Michael was not Peter Masters, even excuses found
no easy flow in his presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m delighted,&#8221; said Mr. Aston, and looked it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>He had breakfasted in his room, so he sat down by
Christopher and tried to find out the reason of the
opportune return.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your letters did not sound at all bored.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only realised it yesterday evening,&#8221; returned
Christopher, with great gravity, &#8220;so we&mdash;that is I&mdash;came
down by the mail last night&mdash;and Nevil....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevil?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I picked him up, you know. He was seeing
a man in Leamington.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher carved ham carefully, and avoided Mr.
Aston&#8217;s eye, smiling to himself over his promise to
Nevil not to betray him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevil went to London. How did&mdash;&#8221; Mr. Aston
stopped suddenly, &#8220;Christopher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, St. Michael.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not to lie to me whatever you do to
others. Tell me what it means.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher regarded him doubtfully and then
laughed outright.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevil did not like travelling alone. He thought
he would get lost, so he asked me to look after him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He went from London to Leamington to get a
companion to travel home with?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. Isn&#8217;t it like him, St. Michael?&#8221;</p>
<p>They again looked steadily at each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;And being a bit weary of fighting for the right of
individual existence,&#8221; went on Christopher, &#8220;I agreed
to bring him home. Mr. Masters has been most kind,
but he does like his own way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what about you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I like mine, too. That&#8217;s why it was so boring.
How&#8217;s C&aelig;sar?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will be pleased to see you. Where is Nevil?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone to bed, I expect. How he hates travelling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He hates explanations still more, please St.
Michael.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He should have prepared a more plausible story.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He thinks it quite credible. He expected me to
believe&mdash;about the man in Leamington.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>They both laughed and Christopher looked at the
clock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think Vespasian will let me take in
C&aelig;sar&#8217;s breakfast?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He would be delighted, I&#8217;m sure. C&aelig;sar won&#8217;t
believe in Leamington either, Christopher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he will easily believe I was bored&mdash;which is
true. I don&#8217;t think he is as fond of Mr. Masters as
he pretends to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether Aymer believed or not, he asked no questions.
He only remarked that Peter was far more
likely to have been bored and Christopher had no eye
to his own advantage. To which Christopher replied
flippantly that it was a question of &#8220;vantage out,&#8221;
and he was not going to imperil his game with a rash
service.</p>
<p>After that he sat on the foot of the bed and talked
frankly of his visit, and minute by minute the jealous
fire in Aymer&#8217;s heart died down to extinction.</p>
<p>Presently, however, he said abruptly and rather reproachfully:
&#8220;You never told me Mr. Masters had
married.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a confused second the room and the occupants
were lost in a fiery mist and only Christopher&#8217;s voice
lived in the chaos. Then Aymer found himself struggling
to maintain hold of something in the mental
turmoil, he did not know what at first: then that it
was his own voice. It amazed him to hear it quite;
steady and cool.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why should she interest you? Did Peter tell
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Never mentioned it. One day I found Mrs.
Eliot, the housekeeper, in a room, a sort of boudoir,
playing about with holland covers, and I helped her.
What was she like?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Eliot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you old stupid. Mrs. Peter Masters. I know
you knew her, because there&#8217;s a pen-and-ink sketch of
you and Mr. Masters playing cards in the room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, is there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was she like&mdash;to marry Mr. Masters?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like? Like other women,&#8221; returned Aymer,
shortly.</p>
<p>Christopher looked at him sharply and realised he
had committed an indiscretion&mdash;that this was a subject
that might not be handled even with a velvet
glove.</p>
<p>&#8220;Explicit,&#8221; he retorted lightly. &#8220;However, that&#8217;s
not important. Now for something of real moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>He plunged into an account of Peter&#8217;s final offer to
him, and his own refusal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why on earth did you refuse? Wasn&#8217;t it good
enough?&#8221; demanded Aymer curtly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not with P. M. attached. Might as well take
lodgings in Wormwood Scrubs&mdash;quite as much liberty.
But, anyhow, C&aelig;sar, you see now what you have got
to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get you apartments in Wormwood Scrubs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Do be serious. Give me a laboratory here
and some experimental ground. Do, there&#8217;s a dear
good C&aelig;sar.&#8221; In reminiscence of old days he pretended
to rub his head against C&aelig;sar&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you invented Peter&#8217;s offer to wheedle me into
this. I suppose.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. Seriously, C&aelig;sar, if you would, it would
be excellent. I&#8217;ve been thinking it out, I could work
here safely. No one to crib my ideas. But I must
have trial ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Nevil&#8217;s affair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I undertake to manage Nevil if you are
afraid,&#8221; said Christopher, with an air of desperate resolve.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you didn&#8217;t like Marden,&#8221; persisted
C&aelig;sar, fighting in an unreasoning way, against his
own desires, &#8220;and this engaged couple will wander
round and get in the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked Christopher straight in the face with
scrutinising eyes, but he never flinched.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll put up a notice, &#8216;Trespassers will be blown
up.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;d better talk to St. Michael, but remember,
I can&#8217;t buy up the other fellows. You&#8217;d better
have taken Peter&#8217;s offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d much rather bore you than Mr. Masters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not complaining.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was the nearest approach he made to expressing
to Christopher his deep, quiet content at the arrangement
that astute young man had so skilfully
suggested. St. Michael said a little more and Christopher
knew without words that he had pleased them
both.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>
<p>It took very little time for Christopher to establish
himself in the desired manner. Indeed, before another
week had passed the suggestion was an accomplished
fact. After that his actual presence in the house might
almost have been forgotten except by C&aelig;sar. Mr.
Masters&#8217; half serious threat was like a spur to a willing
steed. He spoke little of what he was doing, but the
experimental ground was criss-crossed with strange-coloured
roads, and the little band of men who worked
for him, with the kindly indulgence of the &#8220;young
master&#8217;s whim,&#8221; began to talk less of the fad and to
nurse a bewildered wonder at the said young master&#8217;s
strict rule and elaborate care over little points that
slow minds barely saw at all.</p>
<p>As for the engaged couple, Christopher rarely met
them. He did not intentionally avoid either Patricia
or Geoffry, singly or collectively, but he was not sorry
their preoccupation and his separated them. He did
not lose his sense of possessorship of Patricia: in his
innermost mind she was still his, and Geoffry was but
the owner of an outside visible Patricia that was but
one expression of the woman who stood crowned and
waiting in his heart.</p>
<p>There was no question of the wedding, or if there
were between themselves, Geoffry was not allowed to
voice it. Patricia was enjoying life and in no hurry
to forego or shorten the pleasant days of her engagement.</p>
<p>Towards the end of September Christopher began
to relax his long hours of work and the tense look on
his face gave way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall know in about a fortnight if it&#8217;s coming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
out all right,&#8221; he said to C&aelig;sar abruptly one day, &#8220;and
it&#8217;s a fortnight in which I can do nothing but wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go and play,&#8221; said C&aelig;sar, watching him anxiously,
&#8220;you concentrate too much. You&#8217;ll be getting nervous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher laughed and gripped C&aelig;sar&#8217;s hand in
his firm, steady grasp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never better in my life,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Concentration
is an excellent thing. I&#8217;m beginning to appreciate
Nevil.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spent the next five days in true Nevil fashion,
however, following the whim of the moment, and
&#8220;lazing&#8221; as thoroughly as he had worked. Geoffry
and Patricia claimed his attendance, or Patricia did
and Geoffry made no protest. They were supremely
happy days. The three talked of nothing in particular,
just the easy surface aspect of the world and the moment&#8217;s
sunshine, and Geoffry was secretly surprised to
find his pleasure so little diminished by the third
presence.</p>
<p>Then one day that wore no different outer aspect
to its fellows in their livery of autumn sunshine, the
three walked over the wooded ridge to the open downland
where the brown windswept turf was interspaced
with stretches of stubble and blue-green &#8220;roots,&#8221;
where a haze of shimmering light hung over copse and
field, and beyond the undulating near country a line of
hills purple and grey melted into the sky-line.</p>
<p>They had discussed hotly a disputed point as they
mounted from the valley and came out on this good
land of promise in a sudden silence. Patricia seated
herself on the soft turf at the edge of a little chalk pit
and sat in her accustomed attitude with her hands
folded, looking straight before her, and the two men
sat on either side of her. And over all three a sense
of the smallness of the matter over which they had
differed drifted in varied manners.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>Geoffry realised how little he really cared about it.
Christopher was amused at their futile efforts to solve
a problem of which they knew nothing, but Patricia
was angry, first that she had been betrayed into expressing
concern in something of which she was really
ignorant, and secondly that neither Christopher nor
Geoffry had agreed with her. The matter of the discussion&mdash;it
arose from the subject of village charities&mdash;became
of no importance, but the sense of irritation
remained with her, and she was unaccountably
cross with Christopher. Geoffry&#8217;s point of view she
could ignore, but Christopher&#8217;s worried her.</p>
<p>Geoffry dismissed the whole thing most easily; he
did not trouble about Christopher&#8217;s view, and he
thought Patricia&#8217;s a little queer, but then to him Patricia&#8217;s
views were not Patricia herself. He made the
common mistake of divorcing that particular aspect of
his lady love with which he was best acquainted from
the multitudinous prisms of her womanhood. He
would have allowed vaguely that she had &#8220;moods,&#8221;
that these overshadowed occasionally the sunny, beautiful
girl he loved, but no conception of her as a whole
had entered his mind. He was in love with one prism
of a complex whole, or rather with one colour of the
rainbow itself.</p>
<p>This particular truth with regard to Geoffry&#8217;s estimate
of Patricia impressed itself on Christopher with
disagreeable persistency during the walk, and renewed
that nearly forgotten fear that had come to him during
the ride from Milton in the spring.</p>
<p>So presently he found himself watching her inner
attitude towards her accepted lover in the forbidden
way, without sufficient knowledge of what he was
actually doing to stop it. Perhaps some subtle appreciation
of this in the subconscious realm, roused
a like uneasiness and dissatisfaction in Patricia herself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<p>At all events Christopher soon found grounds for
no immediate fear and left the future to itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we go on?&#8221; he suggested, marking how her
hands grew white as she pressed them together.</p>
<p>She negatived the proposal, imperiously saying they
had only just got there and she wanted to rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are getting lazy, Patricia,&#8221; said her lover
gravely. &#8220;I warn you, it&#8217;s the one unpardonable sin
in my eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mistake restlessness for energy,&#8221; she retorted
quickly. &#8220;I&#8217;m never lazy. Ask Christopher.&#8221;</p>
<p>Geoffry did no such thing. He continued to fling
stones at a mark on the lower lip of the chalk pit.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fairly hard to distinguish, anyhow,&#8221; said
Christopher, thoughtfully. &#8220;There are people who
call Nevil lazy, whereas he isn&#8217;t. He only takes all
his leisure in one draught.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s simple enough, isn&#8217;t it?
I never feel lazy so long as I&#8217;m doing something&mdash;moving
about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Geoffry jumped down into the little white pit as he
spoke, as if to demonstrate his remark. Patricia looked
scornful.</p>
<p>&#8220;So long as your are restless, you mean,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you must teach me better if you can. I
say, Patricia, do you always turn reproof on the reprover&#8217;s
head?&#8221;</p>
<p>He leant against the bank looking up at her, smiling
in his easy, good-tempered way. He wished vaguely
the line of frown on her pretty forehead would go.
He wondered if she had a headache.</p>
<p>He ventured to put his hand over hers when he was
sure Christopher was not looking. She neither answered
the caress nor resented it.</p>
<p>Presently he began to explore the hollow, poking
into all the rabbit-holes with his stick.</p>
<p>Christopher sat silent, which was a mistake, for it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
left her irritation but one object on which to expend
itself, and after all it was Geoffry who should have
tried to please her by sitting still.</p>
<p>Suddenly a frightened rabbit burst out of a disturbed
hole, and Geoffry, with a shout of delight, in
pure instinct flung a stone. By a strange, unhappy
fluke, expected least of all by himself, the stone hit the
poor little terrified thing and it rolled over dead. He
picked it up by its ears and called to them triumphantly
to witness his luck, with boyish delight in the unexpected,
though the chances were he would never have
flung the stone at all had he dreamt of destroying it.</p>
<p>A second flint whizzed through the air, grazing the
side of his head. He dropped the rabbit and stood
staring blankly at the two on the bank.</p>
<p>Patricia&#8217;s white, furious face blazed on him. Christopher
was grasping her hands, his face hardly less
white.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you hurt?&#8221; he called over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; the other stammered out, unaware of the
blood streaming down the side of his head, and then
dabbed his handkerchief on it. &#8220;It&#8217;s only a scratch.
What&#8217;s happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Patricia mistook you for a rabbit, I think,&#8221; returned
Christopher grimly and added to her in a low
voice, &#8220;Do you know you struck him, Patricia?&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave a shiver and put her hands to her face.
Even then he did not leave go of her wrists.</p>
<p>&#8220;A happy fluke you didn&#8217;t aim so well as I did,&#8221;
called Geoffry, unsteadily coming towards them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t come,&#8221; said Christopher sharply. &#8220;Wait
a moment. Patricia,&#8221; he tried to pull her hands from
her face: her golden head dropped against his shoulder
and he put his arms round her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter with Patricia. Is she ill?&#8221;
asked Geoffry at his shoulder, his voice altered and
strained.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right now. Sorry I wasn&#8217;t quicker, Geoffry.
Don&#8217;t touch her yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Geoffry was hard pressed already not to thrust
the other aside, and he laid his hand on the girl&#8217;s arm.
Christopher never offered to move.</p>
<p>&#8220;Patricia, what&#8217;s the matter. You haven&#8217;t really
hurt me, you know. What on earth were you doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>But she gave no sign she heard him. Only her
hands clung close to Christopher and she trembled a
little.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is ill,&#8221; cried Geoffry quickly. &#8220;Put her
down, Christopher, she&#8217;s faint.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, she is not,&#8221; returned the other through
clenched teeth, &#8220;she will be all right directly, if you&#8217;ll
give her time. For heaven&#8217;s sake go away, man.
Don&#8217;t let her see you like that. Don&#8217;t you know your
head is cut.&#8221;</p>
<p>Geoffry put up his hand mechanically, and found
plentiful evidence of this truth, but he was still bewildered
as to what had actually happened, and he
was aching with desire to take her from Christopher&#8217;s
hold.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was just an accident,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;She
didn&#8217;t mean to hit me, of course. Let her lie down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She did mean to hit you, just at the moment,&#8221;
returned the other, very quietly, &#8220;haven&#8217;t you been
told. Oh, do go away, there&#8217;s a good fellow. I&#8217;ll
explain presently.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was sick with dread lest Patricia should give
way to one of her terrible paroxysms of sorrow before
them both. She was trembling all over and he did not
know how much self-control she had gained. Then
suddenly he understood what was the real trouble with
poor Geoffry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind my holding her, Geoffry,&#8221; he went on
swiftly, &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen her like this before and understand,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
and I can always stop her, but she mustn&#8217;t see
you like that first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Geoffry stood biting his lip and then turned abruptly
on his heel and left them&mdash;and for all his relief at his
departure, Christopher felt a faint glow of contempt
at his obedience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he gone?&#8221; Patricia lifted her white face and
black-rimmed eyes to his.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I hurt him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not seriously. Sorry I was not quicker, Patricia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not even know myself,&#8221; she answered,
wearily. &#8220;Christopher, why was I born? Why
didn&#8217;t someone let me die?&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave her a little shake. &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk like a baby.
But, Patricia, how is it Geoffry doesn&#8217;t know?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked round with languid interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did he go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sent him away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He went?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What else could he do?&#8221;</p>
<p>She made no further remark, but sat clasping and
unclasping her nervous hands, as powerless against
the desperate languor assailing her as she had been
against the gust of passion.</p>
<p>Across the wide, smiling land westward a closed
shadow, sharp of outline and rapid of flight, drove
across the stubble field, sank in an intervening valley,
and skimmed again over the close green turf to their
feet as it touched the edge of the chalk pit. She shivered
a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take me home, Christopher.&#8221;</p>
<p>He helped her up and with steady hands assisted
her to smooth her hair and put on her hat, and then
they turned and walked back along the path they had
come. Christopher was greatly troubled. It seemed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
him incredible that Geoffry had been left in ignorance
of this cruel inheritance. He tried to gauge the effect
of it on his apparently unsuspecting mind and was
uneasy and dissatisfied over the result.</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone must explain to Geoffry,&#8221; he said presently;
&#8220;will you like him to come over to-night and
tell him yourself, Patricia?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to see him.&#8221; There was a deep note
of fatigue in her voice, also a new accent of indifference.
Her mind was in no way occupied with her
lover&#8217;s attitude towards the unhappy episode.</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone&#8217;s got to see him and explain. It&#8217;s only
fair,&#8221; persisted Christopher resolutely.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is there to explain. What does it matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He thinks it was an accident.&#8221;</p>
<p>She walked on a little quicker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Patricia, you must tell him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she turned and faced him, and her pallor was
burnt out with red.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christopher, I will not see him. I can&#8217;t. What&#8217;s
the use? What can he do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must learn how to help you, learn how to stop
it,&#8221; he said doggedly.</p>
<p>She gave a curious, choking laugh. &#8220;Geoffry stop
it? Don&#8217;t be absurd, Christopher. You know he&#8217;d
make me ten times worse if he tried. Anyhow, I&#8217;m
not going to marry him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Patricia!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t. I can&#8217;t bear anything now. But I
won&#8217;t marry him, or anyone. It&#8217;s not safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went on down the path swiftly, without looking
back, hardly conscious of the tears falling from
her brimming eyes. Christopher followed her silently,
furious with himself because of some unreasoning exultation
in his heart, some clamorous sense of kinship
with the golden land and laden earth that had been
absent as they came, but it died when, presently emerging
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
from the wood on to the park land facing Marden,
she turned to him again regardless of her tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t want to marry me now, anyhow,&#8221; she
said wistfully, with a child&#8217;s appealing look of distress.</p>
<p>A great pity welled up in his heart and drowned the
last thought of self, carrying visions of the cruel isolation
this grim inheritage might entail on her, and he
had hard work to refrain from taking her in his arms
then and there to hold for ever shielded from the relentless
pressure of her life. The temptation was more
subtle and harder to withstand than on the sunny,
gorse-covered cliff at Milton, for it was her need and
her pain that cried for help and love, and she who
suffered because he withstood. He could in no wise
see what course he was to take beyond the minute, but
he knew quite clearly what course he must not take,
and such surety was the reward he won from that
other fight.</p>
<p>He answered her appeal now with quite other words
than those she perhaps sought, and it was the hardest
pang of all to know it and recognise the vague discomfort
in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t be unfair to Geoffry, Patricia. You
haven&#8217;t any right to say that. He will want to do his
best for you when he understands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He went away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sent him. I&mdash;I was afraid you were going to
cry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Had he done wrong? He cast his thoughts back
rapidly. He knew he could not have borne that they
two should witness one of her wild fits of repentance
and misery. It would have been unbearably unfit. He
could not have left her to Geoffry, and yet it had been
Geoffry&#8217;s right. He walked on by her side wondering
where he had blundered.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would not have gone, Christopher, no matter
who said so.&#8221; Her directness was dangerous.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
She was then going to allow herself no illusions of
any kind, not even concerning the man she loved, and
Christopher became suddenly aware he was very
young: that they were all three very young, and had
no previous experience to guide them in this difficult
pass, but must gain it for themselves, gain it perhaps
at greater cost than he could willingly contemplate.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is no question of me, whatever,&#8221; he said slowly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been used to you and I understand. I don&#8217;t
know how it would be if I had not known, neither do
you, but it&#8217;s clear, you or Nevil must explain the matter
to Geoffry at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not my place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was mere chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>She slipped her arm through his in the old way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Christopher, I love Nevil, and he&#8217;s awfully
good, but you are like my own brother. Please pretend
you are really. If I had a brother, he would see
Geoffry for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Nevil might not like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a difficult pass, for how could he explain to
her it was of Geoffry he was thinking, not of Nevil.
His evasion at least raised a little smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevil! An explanation taken off his hands!&#8221; She
spread her own abroad in mock amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him yourself, Patricia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Christopher!&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked straight ahead, a certain rigidness in the
outline of his face betokening a decision at variance
with his will.</p>
<p>&#8220;What am I to tell him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not tell him the silly thing you said just
now, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What thing?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></p>
<p>&#8220;About not marrying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; she said indifferently, &#8220;he
won&#8217;t marry me if he thinks I tried to hit him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher closed his mind and reason to so illogical
a conclusion, but he disputed the point no more,
and it was not till he left her and turned to face instantly
the task she had laid upon him, that he realised
how overwhelmingly difficult it was.</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I suppose no one realised you did not know all about
it as you&#8217;d known them all so long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher concluded his simple and direct account
with these words, and waited vainly for a reply from
his hearer, who stood by the window with his back
to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so nearly a thing of the past, too, that it hardly
seemed worth mentioning,&#8221; he went on presently, an
uneasy wonder at the silence growing on him.</p>
<p>At length Geoffry spoke, in a thick, slow way, like
a man groping in darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean she did throw that stone deliberately,
meaning to hit me?&#8221;</p>
<p>He had no sight at present for the wider issues that
beset them or for Patricia&#8217;s story: his attention was
concentrated on the incident immediately affecting him
and he could see it in no light but that of dull horror.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deliberately tried to do it?&#8221; he repeated, turning
to Christopher.</p>
<p>&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t anything deliberate about it. She
just flung the stone at you precisely as you flung one
at the rabbit. Sort of blind instinct. She does not
know now she really hurt you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He glanced at the crossing strips of plaster with
which the other&#8217;s head was adorned on the right side.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s horrible,&#8221; muttered Geoffry, &#8220;I can&#8217;t understand
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s simple enough.&#8221; There was growing impatience
in Christopher&#8217;s voice. &#8220;She inherits this
ghastly temper as I&#8217;ve told you. It&#8217;s like a sudden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
gust of wind if she&#8217;s not warned. It takes her off her
feet, as it were, but she&#8217;s nearly learnt to stand firm.
She has a wretched time after.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s madness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing of the kind. She wasn&#8217;t taught to
control it as a child. They just treated it as something
she couldn&#8217;t help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By heavens, are you going to make out she can
help it, and that that makes it better?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher faced him with amazed indignation.
Geoffry&#8217;s whole attitude and reception of his story
seemed to him incredibly one-sided.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it&#8217;s better. A hundred times better.
Do you mean you&#8217;d rather have her the victim of a
real madness she could not control? Think what you
are saying, man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To me, it&#8217;s fairly unbearable if it&#8217;s something she
can help and doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exasperation nearly choked the other. To have to
defend Patricia at all was almost a desecration in his
eyes, but he was her ambassador and he stuck to his
orders.</p>
<p>&#8220;She does help it. She&#8217;s nearly mastered it
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Geoffry put his hand to his injured head and gave
a short laugh.</p>
<p>Christopher got up abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What am I to tell her, then?&#8221; he demanded
shortly.</p>
<p>The real tenor of the discussion seemed to break
suddenly upon Geoffry and he was cruelly alive to his
own inability to meet it. He spoke hurriedly and almost
pleadingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go yet. I&#8217;ve got to think this out. Can&#8217;t
you help me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s there to think about? I&#8217;ve told you. I
can tell you how to help her if you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to think of a jolly sight more than you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
seem to imagine,&#8221; returned the sorely beset young
man irritably, but unable to keep a touch of conscious
superiority out of his voice, &#8220;a jolly sight more, if I
marry her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you marry her?&#8221; Christopher turned on him
with blazing eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying I shan&#8217;t&mdash;but it&#8217;s a pretty bad pass
for us both. I know how she feels. Marriage isn&#8217;t
just a question of pleasing oneself, you see. I must
think it out for both of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher began to speak and desisted. The other
went on in an aggrieved tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to have been told. Heredity of that sort
isn&#8217;t a thing to be played with, you know. Anything
might happen. Why wasn&#8217;t I told?&#8221; He walked to
and fro, and stopped by Christopher again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t mind a bit,&#8221; he burst out, &#8220;if it were
just a bad joke, if she flung at me in fun and didn&#8217;t
expect to hit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has a good aim as a rule,&#8221; put in Christopher,
too blind with fury now to realise the other&#8217;s unhinged
condition, but Geoffry went on unheeding.</p>
<p>&#8220;But to do it in a rage, and for nothing. Just a
cold-blooded attack and no warning. I can&#8217;t get over
it. Anything might happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>His first indignant pang that Christopher had been
sent on this awkward errand had died out in the stress
of the moment: he was ready to appeal for sympathy,
for help, or even bare comprehension in the impossible
situation in which he found himself, but Christopher
had nothing to bestow on him but blind, furious resentment.
He longed to be quit of his service and
free to give way to his own wrath.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was plenty of warning for anyone with
eyes and sense to use them, and there was nothing
cold-blooded about it whatever, as I&#8217;ve told you fifty
times. If you choose to make a mountain out of a
molehill you must, but I&#8217;ll not help you. I would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
done my best for both of you if you&#8217;d taken it decently.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You? What concern is it of yours?&#8221; retorted the
other, stung back to his original jealousy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my concern so far as Patricia chooses it to
be,&#8221; he answered curtly. &#8220;I&#8217;m going now. You&#8217;d
better write to her yourself, when you&#8217;ve decided if the
risk is worth taking or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my risk at least, not yours&mdash;yet awhile,&#8221; was
the unguarded reply.</p>
<p>The young men faced each other for a moment with
passions at the point of explosion. It was Christopher
who recollected his position of ambassador first
and turned abruptly to the door. In the hall he narrowly
escaped encounter with Mrs. Leverson, Geoffry&#8217;s
large and ample mother, but slipped out of a
garden door on hearing the rustle of her dress. In
the open air he breathed freely again and hastened to
regain his motor, which he had left near the gates.
Once outside Logan Park he turned the car northward
along a fairly deserted high-road and drove at
full pressure, until the hot passion of his heart cooled
and his pulse fell into beat with the throb of the engine,
and he found himself near Basingstoke. Then
he turned homeward, driving with greater caution and
was able to face matters in a logically sane manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t marry and it&#8217;s a blessed thing for both
of them,&#8221; was the burden of his thoughts, though it
mitigated not one bit his indignant attitude towards
Geoffry. Presently he turned to his own interest in
the matter.</p>
<p>His first idea was that he was free to claim her who
was his own at once, without loss of time, but that impulse
died down before a better appreciation of facts.
Patricia must be left free in mind to regain possession
of every faculty, that was but common fairness: also
he was by no means certain at this time what response
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
she would make to his claim, and if it should be a
negative his position at Marden would be difficult, and
there was Aymer to consider. Quite slowly, and with
no appreciable connection with the chief subject a recollection
of that first journey with Peter Masters from
London came to the surface of his mind, and written
large across, in Peter&#8217;s own handwriting, were the
words, &#8220;Aymer&#8217;s son.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had put that idea deliberately behind his back,
hidden it in the deepest recess of his mind, with a
strange content and a germ of pride unconfessed and
unacknowledged to himself. It remained a secret feeling
that touched at no point his steady faith and devotion
to his dead mother.</p>
<p>But Peter&#8217;s suggestion had utterly quenched his
original intention of asking Mr. Aston or C&aelig;sar of his
own origin, as he had intended to do at the time of his
return from Belgium. The actual possibility or impossibility
of the idea counted nothing so long as the faintest
shadow of it lurked there in the background. If
it were a fact, it was their secret, deliberately withheld;
if it were not, he must be the last to give it
life.</p>
<p>The incalculable power of suggestion had done its
work and the suggested lie, taking root, had grown at
the pace of all ill weeds and obscured his usually clear
visions of essentials. The more he questioned the
possible fact the denser seemed the screen between him
and Patricia, until he called himself a fool to have
dreamed she was ever his to claim at all.</p>
<p>It was in this wholly unsatisfactory mood he was
called upon, on his return, to face Patricia and give his
own account of the interview.</p>
<p>Patricia was lying in wait for him at the door of
her own sanctum, which he had to pass on his way to
his room. He would have gladly deferred the interview,
but she summoned him imperiously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a good hour till dinner, Christopher, and
I must know what he said. How long you&#8217;ve
been!&#8221;</p>
<p>He followed her in and closed the door behind him.
The little white-panelled room was so perfect an expression
of its owner that at all times Christopher felt
a still wonder fall on him to find himself within its
confines. It was singularly uncrowded and free, and
the monotonous note of light colour was broken by
splashes of brightness that were as an embroidery to
the plain setting.</p>
<p>Patricia turned to him with questioning eyes and
no words, and the difficulty of his task made him a
little curt and direct in speech, for otherwise how
could he avoid voicing the tenderness that flowed to
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him about it and he seemed surprised he
hadn&#8217;t been told before, and he hadn&#8217;t really taken in
what happened this afternoon at all. I expect he&#8217;ll
write to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>A faint ghost of a smile touched her white face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not really telling me what I want to
know, Christopher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing else. He hadn&#8217;t got the real
focus of the thing when I left.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned away and leant her arm on the mantelpiece,
wondering in a half-comprehensive way why the
stinging sense of humiliation and helpless shame
seemed so much less since Christopher had come.
What had been well-nigh unbearable was now but a
monotonous burden that wearied but did not crush
her: she feared it no longer. He stood looking at her
a moment, gathering as it were into himself all he could
of the bitterness that he knew she carried at her heart,
and then turned away to the window, realising the
greatness of her trouble and yearning to do that very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
thing which unconsciously by mere action of his receptive
sympathy he had done already.</p>
<p>Presently she came to him and put her hand on his
arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll understand, anyhow, Christopher,&#8221; she said
with a little sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall all do that here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Geoffry won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose he can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>She recognised the hard note in his voice at once,
and seating herself on the window-seat set to work to
fathom it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will help me if you can tell me exactly how he
took it, Christopher. Was he angry, or sorry, or horrified
or what?&#8221;</p>
<p>He had to consider a moment what, out of fairness
to Geoffry, he must withhold, and choose what he
considered the most pardonable aspect.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he was frightened, Patricia, not at you, so
much as at some silly ideas he&#8217;s got hold of about
heredity. Not his own: just half-digested ideas, and
he probably finds it pretty difficult to listen to them at
all. He just thinks he ought to, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the faint little smile in her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a dear, Christopher, when you try to
whitewash things. Listen to me. Whatever Geoffry
said or does or writes, I&#8217;ve decided I will not marry
him. I&#8217;ve written to say so and posted it before you
came in, so he should know that nothing he had said
or done influenced me in the slightest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher gave a sigh of relief and she went on in
the same deliberate way.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I shall never marry at all. I can&#8217;t face it
again. I&#8217;ll tell Renata about Geoffry, and may I also
tell her you will explain to the others if she can&#8217;t
satisfy them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do anything you wish.&#8221; Then he suddenly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
claimed for himself a little latitude and spoke from
his heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Patricia, dear, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve done it. It&#8217;s the
best and right thing, however hard, and if I could
manage to take all the bother of it for you I would.
Honestly, Geoffry wouldn&#8217;t have been able to help you,
I fear. But as to never marrying, you must not say
that or make rash vows, and you must never, never let
yourself think it isn&#8217;t safe to marry, or that sort of
nonsense. It&#8217;s in your own hands. We are always
strong enough for our own job, so C&aelig;sar says. Shall
I find Renata and ask her to come to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>They stood facing each other, an arm&#8217;s length separating
them, and she looked at him across the little
space with so great gratitude and affection in her eyes
that he felt humbled at the little he offered from so
great a store at his heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christopher, how do girls manage who haven&#8217;t
a brother like you? I&#8217;ve been fretting because I was
all alone and no one to stand by me&mdash;will you forgive
me that, dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes were brimming with tears. She laid her
hand on his arm again and drew nearer. Her entire
ignorance of their true relationship to each other left
her a child appealing for some outward sign of the one
dear bond she knew between them.</p>
<p>Christopher recognised it and put his arm round her
and she kissed him. &#8220;I&#8217;ll never forget again that
I&#8217;ve got you,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;such a dear good
brother.&#8221;</p>
<p>He neither acquiesced nor dissented that point, but
very gravely and quietly he kissed her too, and she
thought the bond of fraternity between then was
sealed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
</div>
<p>Matters were made as easy for Patricia as the united
efforts of those who loved her could compass. Geoffry,
in his gratitude for her decisive action, which lifted
the onus of a broken engagement from his shoulders,
found a substantial ground for his belief that they had
sacrificed themselves on the altar of duty. Mrs.
Leverson sighed profoundly with unconscious satisfaction
over the highly heroic behaviour of them both
and yielded easily to Geoffry&#8217;s desire to travel. They
eventually sold Logan Park, which they had purchased
about ten years previously, and passed out of
the ken of the lives that were so nearly linked with
theirs.</p>
<p>Life renewed its wonted routine at Marden except
that Christopher was often absent for weeks together.
The final experiments hung fire and he had to seek new
material and fresh inspiration further afield, but never
for long. The end of a set term would see him back
by Aymer&#8217;s side sharing his hopes and disappointments
impartially, always declaring that nowhere could
he work with better success than at Marden Court.
He was five years older than his natural age in development
and resource, and the dogged obstinacy that
was so direct a heritage from his father, stood him in
good stead in his stiff fight with the difficulties that
stood between him and his goal. Peter Masters made
no sign and no greater success seemed to crown the
other workers&#8217; endeavours, but there was always the
secret pressure of unknown competition at work and
it told on Christopher. He became more silent and
so absorbed in his task as to lose touch of outside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
matters altogether. It was this absorption in his ambition
that made the daily intercourse with Patricia
possible at all. Unsuspected by her, his love, lying in
abeyance, was but awaiting the growth in her of an
answering harmony that must come to completion before
he could make his full demand of it.</p>
<p>One day in March, when the land was swept with
cold winds and beaten with rain, Christopher came
out of the little wooden building, where he worked,
and stood bareheaded a moment in the driving rain.
First he looked towards the house and then turning
sharply towards the left made his way once more to
the edge of the last of the experimental tracks that
threaded that distant corner of the park like the lines
of a spider&#8217;s web.</p>
<p>He stood looking down at the firm grey surface
from which the pouring rain ran off to the side channels
as cleanly as from polished marble. He walked a
few yards down its elastic, easy-treading surface, ruminating
over the &#8220;weight and edge&#8221; tests that had
been applied, and on the durability trials from the little
machine that had run for so many long days and
nights over a similar surface within the wooden
shanty.</p>
<p>It was morning now. His men, whose numbers had
increased each month, had gone to breakfast, and he
was alone with his finished work.</p>
<p>The strain and absorption of the long months was
over. He had at last conquered the material difficulties
that had been ranged against him. The dream of
the boy had become a tangible reality, ready by reason
of its material existence to claim its own place in the
physical world. This unnamed substance whose composition
had awaited in Nature&#8217;s laboratory the intelligent
mingling of a master hand, would add to the
store of the world&#8217;s riches and the world&#8217;s ease, and
was his gift to his generation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></p>
<p>As he stood looking down at the completed roadway,
the Roadmaker suddenly remembered his own
slight years and the inconceivable fraction of time he
had laboured for so wide a result, and there swept up
to him across the level way a new knowledge of his
relationship to all the past&mdash;that he was but the servant
of those who had preceded him and had but
brought into the light of day a simple secret matured
long ago in the patient earth.</p>
<p>It is in this spirit of true humility and in the recognition
of their actual place in the world that all Great
Discoverers find their highest joy. It is the joy of
service that is theirs, the loftiest ambition that can fire
the heart of man, making him accept with thankfulness
his part as a tool to the great artifices and filling
him with love and reverence for the work he has been
used to complete. As Christopher stood bareheaded
in the rain that windy March morning, his heart swept
clear for the time of all personal pride or self-gratification,
he offered himself in unconscious surrender
again to the Power that had used him, craving only to
be used, divining clearly that achievement is but the
starting post to new endeavour.</p>
<p>At last he turned away, locked up the hut and went
down towards the house, and at the entrance of the
little plantation between park and garden he met
Patricia.</p>
<p>They exchanged no greeting but a smile, and as he
stood on the slope above her, looking at her, he was
aware of a great sense of peace and rest, and on a
sudden, her understanding leapt to meet his.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is done&mdash;you have finished it?&#8221; she cried, and
her hands went out to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, quietly, freeing himself from the
strange inward pressure by the touch of that outward
union. &#8220;This piece of work is done, Patricia. The
thing is there&mdash;my Road stuff. It&#8217;s all right. It will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
stand whatever it is asked to stand. It is ready to use
if anyone will use it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m glad&mdash;so glad!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Christopher,
it is just the best thing in the world to know
you have succeeded.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her complete sympathy and generous joy seemed
to open his mind to the outward expression of the
speaker, which of late, since the breaking of her engagement
with Geoffry, he had tried hard not to
observe.</p>
<p>It seemed to him her face had lost a little of its
childish roundness, that there was something accentuated
about her that was nameless and yet expected.
Also for the first time in his life he was conscious that
her presence by his side was helpful. He had been
unaware till she came that he needed any aid in what,
to him, was a great moment in his life, but he knew
it was restful and good to walk by her, a strange relief
to tell her how the last difficulties that had arisen
on the heels of each other had finally been met: how
strong had been his temptation to give his discovery
to the world before the tedious tests had gone to the
uttermost limits experimental trials could reach.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so simple really,&#8221; he said, &#8220;just a question of
proportions once the material is there. I felt anyone
might hit on it any day, and yet it would have been
such a sickening thing to have someone else planting
an improvement on the top of it within a few months.
It may need it now, but at least it would mean the test
of years, and not immediate improvement. Do you
happen to know if C&aelig;sar had a good night or
not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to have some breakfast yourself first.
I don&#8217;t believe you remember you never came in to
dinner last night at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I? Breakfast must wait till I&#8217;ve seen
C&aelig;sar anyhow. He must know before anyone else,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
and you&#8217;ll never be able to hold your tongue through
breakfast, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m first, after all.&#8221; She tilted her chin a little
with a complacent nod at him.</p>
<p>He stopped with a puzzled expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you are. It never struck me&mdash;but&mdash;but,&#8221; he
hesitated, unable to read his own hazy idea, and concluded,
&#8220;but, you are only a girl, so it doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>The look in his eyes atoned for the &#8220;only,&#8221; and she
bore no resentment, for she had met his look and read
there the thought he could not decipher, and it sunk
deep into her heart, with illuminating power.</p>
<p>At the garden door, where the paths branched, she
stood aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go and tell Aymer and get your breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not going to stay out in this rain?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I love rain, and I&#8217;ve had breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before he could stop her she had turned and disappeared
up the winding path that led out eventually on
to the open down.</p>
<p>Christopher looked after her a moment doubtfully,
but her strange fondness for walking in the rain was
well known and he had no reason or right to stop her.
So he went indoors to C&aelig;sar. But Patricia walked
on with rapid steps, never pausing till she was
well outside the confines of the park amongst the
red ploughed fields and bare downs. The rain
swept in her face and the wind rushed by her as she
walked with lifted head and exultant heart, hearing
the whole chorus of creation around her, conscious
only of the uplifting joy of the great light that had
broken in on her. At last she stopped by a gate that
led into a field of newly-turned earth&mdash;downland just
broken by the plough, lying bare and open to the breath
of heaven, and beyond, the swelling line of downs was
blurred with misty rain and merged into the driving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
grey clouds above. Behind her in an oak tree a robin
was singing with passionate intensity. She drew a
deep breath and then held out her arms to the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand, I understand,&#8221; she whispered.
&#8220;Love and Christopher. Love and Christopher, there
is nothing else in the whole world.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had accepted the revelation without fear, without
question, without distrust. She gave no thought
at all at present as to Christopher&#8217;s attitude to her, as
to whether he had anything to give in return for her
great gift of herself. She gave herself to Love first,
to him after, if such were Love&#8217;s will. But it made no
difference whether he knew or not, she was his, and
the recognition drowned all lesser emotion in the great
depth of its joy. She wasted no time in lamenting
her blindness or the interlude with another lesser love:
it troubled her not at all, for by such steps had she
climbed to this unexpected summit. Just at present
the glory of that was all-satisfying, so much more than
she had ever looked for or imagined possible, that to
demand the uttermost crown of his returning love was
in these first moments too great a consummation to
be borne.</p>
<p>She stood there with her hands clasped and the only
words she found were, &#8220;Christopher and Love,&#8221; and
again, &#8220;Love and Christopher,&#8221; as if they were the
alphabet of a new language.</p>
<p>Quite slowly the physical horizon crept up to this
plane of exultant joy and claimed her, but even as
she recognised the claim she knew the familiar world
would bear for her a new aspect, and found no resentment,
only a quiet relief as it closed her in. The languor
and fatigue of the backward journey did not
distress her, every step of the way she was studying
the news.</p>
<p>Every blade of grass and every twig spoke of this
new language to her, proclaiming a kinship that made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
her rich in sympathy and comprehension of all humble
lovely things.</p>
<p>She was seized with fear when she reached home
that she would encounter Christopher in the hall before
she was prepared to accept him as the most unchanged
point of her altered world. Instead she met
Constantia Wyatt, who was at Marden with her
family for Easter, just coming down, who asked her
if she had been having a shower bath.</p>
<p>Now Constantia felt a proprietary right over Patricia
by reason of her knowledge of Christopher&#8217;s
sentiments, and her own prophetic instincts. She had
most carefully refrained from interference in their
affairs, however, and accepted the post of lookeron
with praiseworthy consistency. But she looked on
with very wide-opened eyes, and this morning when
Patricia answered with almost emphatic offhandedness
that she had only been for a solitary walk in the
rain, she could not refrain from remarking that she
appeared to have gathered something more than raindrops
and an appetite on her walk, and only laughed
when Patricia, betraying no further curiosity, hurried
on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something has happened,&#8221; she thought to herself.
&#8220;Patricia&#8217;s eyes did not look like that last night.
She is grown up.&#8221;</p>
<p>But her rare discretion kept her silent, and when
later on she was confronted with the news of Christopher&#8217;s
victory she guessed one-half of the secret of
Patricia&#8217;s shining eyes.</p>
<p>Patricia exchanged her dripping garments for dry
ones and curled herself up on the sofa in her own room
before the fire, with full determination to fathom her
growing unwillingness to meet Christopher, and to
accommodate herself to the new existence, but the
gentle languor of mental emotion and physical effort
took the caressing warmth of the fire to their aid and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
cradled her to sleep instead, till the balance of nature
was restored.</p>
<p>It was in this manner that Patricia and Christopher
arrived at the same cross roads of their lives, where
the devious tracks might merge into one another, or,
being thrust asunder again by some hedge of convention,
continue by a lonely, painful and circuitous
route towards the destined goal.</p>
<p>The matter lay in Patricia&#8217;s hands, little as either
she or Christopher suspected it, and poor Patricia was
hampered by a power of tradition and a lack of complete
faith of Christopher&#8217;s view of her inherited
trouble.</p>
<p>Ever since the broken engagement with Geoffry,
she had bent in spirit before her own weakness, withstanding
it well, and yet a prey to that humiliation of
mind that accepts the imperfect as a penalty, instead
of claiming the perfect as a birthright. Having given
in to this attitude, she now, as a natural consequence,
could but see the view offered from that comparatively
lowly altitude, and that shut her in with the belief her
duty lay in renouncing marriage, and also, more limiting
still in its effect, the idea that Christopher also
held this view in his secret heart.</p>
<p>She wasted no time in the consideration as to
whether he loved her or not: she was sure of that
much crown to her own life; but slowly the false conviction
thrust itself upon her that had he thought
otherwise the long, empty months that had passed
would not have been possible. She was too young a
woman to balance correctly the power of strenuous
occupation on a man as weighed against the emotion
to which a woman will yield her whole being without
a struggle. Looking back on the long days that had
elapsed since the affair by the little chalk pit on the
downs, it seemed to her clear that Christopher had
avoided her, and there was sufficient truth in this to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
make it a dangerous lever when handled in connection
with the fear of her mind.</p>
<p>It was, therefore, by a quite natural following-out
of the mental process that she ultimately arrived at
the conclusion it was her duty to assist Christopher
to renounce herself, and for that purpose, that she
might less hamper his life, she must leave Marden
Court.</p>
<p>The decision was not arrived at all at once. The
day wore on and the natural order of things had
brought her and Christopher face to face at a moment
when she had forgotten there was any difficulty about
it. C&aelig;sar had issued invitations to a family tea in
his room in honour of Christopher&#8217;s achievement, as
was a time-honoured custom when any of the members
of the family distinguished themselves in work or
play. Christopher served tea, as it was C&aelig;sar&#8217;s party,
and it was not until he gave Patricia her cup that he
recollected she had not crossed his path since that
morning in the rain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have you hidden yourself?&#8221; he demanded
severely.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said I could not hold my tongue, so I determined
I&#8217;d prove you false,&#8221; was her flippant rejoinder.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the cost of self-immolation. I think it proves
my point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I appeal to C&aelig;sar.&#8221; She got up and took a chair
close to the sofa.</p>
<p>&#8220;C&aelig;sar, I wish you&#8217;d keep that boy of yours in
order. He is always so convinced he is in the right
that he is unbearable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Allow him latitude to-day. He&#8217;ll meet opposition
enough when he tries to foist this putty-clay of his on
the world. By the way, what are you going to call
it, Christopher?&#8221;</p>
<p>Everyone stopped talking and regarded the Discoverer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
with critical anxiety. He looked slightly embarrassed
and offered no suggestion, and it was Constantia
who insisted airily that they should all propose
names and he should choose from the offered selection.</p>
<p>Christopher was made to take a chair in the midst
of the circle and to demonstrate in plain terms the actual
substances of which the &#8220;Road-stuff,&#8221; as he inelegantly
termed it, was made.</p>
<p>The younger members of the family called pathetically
for some short, ready name that would not tax
pen or tongue. After a long silence Nevil, modestly
suggested &#8220;Hippopodharmataconitenbadistium.&#8221;</p>
<p>This raised a storm of protests, while Constantia&#8217;s
own &#8220;Roadhesion&#8221; received hardly better support.</p>
<p>C&aelig;sar flung out &#8220;Christite&#8221; without concern, and
demanded Patricia&#8217;s contribution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aymerite,&#8221; she ventured.</p>
<p>Christopher&#8217;s glances wandered from one to the
other. She was seated on his own particular chair
close to C&aelig;sar, in whose company she felt a strange
comfort and protection, a security against her own
heart that could not yet be trusted to shield the secret
of her love.</p>
<p>Mr. Aston was called on in his turn and he looked
at Christopher with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we are all wasting our time and wits,&#8221; he
said placidly. &#8220;Christopher has his own name ready
and your suggestions are superfluous.&#8221;</p>
<p>They clamoured for confirmation of this and Christopher
had to admit it was true.</p>
<p>&#8220;I call it Patrimondi,&#8221; he said slowly, his eyes on
Patricia, &#8220;because it will conquer the country and the
world in time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which explanation was accepted more readily by
the younger members of the party than by the elder.</p>
<p>But &#8220;Patrimondi&#8221; it remained, and if he chose to
perpetuate the claims of the future rather than the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
past in this business of nomenclature, it was surely his
own affair. Patricia, at all events, made no objection.
She had recovered her equilibrium to find the relationship
between them was so old that it called for nothing
but mute acceptance on her part: the only thing
that was new was her recognition of the barrier between
them, whose imaginary shadow lay so cold
across her heart.</p>
<p>Constantia offered a refuge. Her watching eyes
divined something of Patricia&#8217;s unrest. She visited
her that night at the period of hair-brushing and found
her dreaming before a dying fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;You get up too early,&#8221; Constantia remonstrated,
&#8220;it&#8217;s a pernicious habit. If you would come and stay
with me in London, I would teach you to keep rational
hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you have me, really?&#8221; cried Patricia, sitting
bolt upright, with every sense alert to seize so
good an opportunity of escape.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes. I&#8217;ve been wanting to have you a long
time. You had better come back to town with me to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like it better than anything in the world,&#8221; asserted
Patricia, fervently and truthfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if people ever grow up at all here,&#8221; Constantia
said, smiling, &#8220;you are all so preposterously
young, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were brought up here yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Constantia laughed outright. &#8220;But I have been
educated since I married: that is when most people&#8217;s
education does begin. We are only preparing for it
before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if one never marries, one remains uneducated,
I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Constantia kissed her. &#8220;Your education is not
likely to be neglected, my dear. Go to bed now, we
will settle with Renata to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
</div>
<p>It is one thing to produce, and another to launch the
production on an unwilling world. Christopher soon
found he had but exchanged an arduous engrossing
task for a sordid uphill struggle. Yet if his mind
sometimes flew back to Peter Masters&#8217; offer, it was
never with any desire to open negotiations with him,
nor did he ever remind Aymer of the possibility. They
fought together against the difficulties that beset the
great venture and their comradeship reduced the irritating
trivialities of the first start to bearable limits.</p>
<p>Since the day when he received Peter Masters&#8217; curt
acknowledgment of satisfaction with the selected car,
neither Christopher nor the Astons had heard one
word from the millionaire. His restored interest in
the family appeared to have evaporated as rapidly as
it had risen, and peace fell on Aymer&#8217;s troubled mind.
He flung himself heart and soul into the business of
launching Christopher&#8217;s discovery, and verified his
cousin&#8217;s old opinion of his business qualities. The
initial difficulties of obtaining the patent being overcome
and a small, private company formed, they started
a factory for the manufacture of Patrimondi within
five miles of Marden, and a decently capable staff was
secured to meet the slow, but steadily increasing, demands
for the new material.</p>
<p>After some months of uphill work they suddenly
received an order for laying the roadways and a special
motor track at an International Exhibition. From
this plane Patrimondi leapt into fame. Within three
months of the opening of the Exhibition the little factory
had doubled its staff and even then could not produce
enough to meet the demand. With the mounting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
strain Christopher began to prove of what metal he
was made. He stuck to the work with steady persistence,
meeting success as he had met difficulties,
counting each but expected incidents in a life&#8217;s work.
This level-headedness enabled him to bear a physical
strain that would have broken down the nerve of any
man more subject to outward conditions. A large proportion
of extra work was entailed on him by the
starting point of Patrimondi being so distant from
London, but he resisted all suggestions to move it
nearer town, or make his own headquarters there, or
take any step that would serve to separate Aymer
from easy contact with the work that made so great
a difference in his monotonous life.</p>
<p>Since the last appearance of Peter Masters, Aymer
had seemed to lose something of his old independent
spirit of resistance. The mine of strength within himself,
which his father had developed, was nearing exhaustion,
and he lived more and more by force of his
interest in outward things, and the active part he
played in Christopher&#8217;s life. But this diminution of
his inward strength made the question of any move too
serious to be contemplated, although they still vaguely
spoke of a time when they would return to London.
Mr. Aston knew that he himself could not face the old
strenuous life again.</p>
<p>He had dropped out of the line of workers too early,
and though seventy years found him still a man of
active habits and vigour of mind, he was too conscious
of his divorce from the past to endure meeting it daily
face to face.</p>
<p>The fortunes of Patrimondi continued to leap forward
by untraceable impulses. They were able to
choose their work now, and Christopher gave the
preference first to roads whose construction was under
his own direction from the very foundation, and
secondly to such work as least separated him from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
C&aelig;sar, but this last fact he was careful to conceal even
from Mr. Aston&#8217;s watchful eyes.</p>
<p>In the world of workers he became known as the
&#8220;Roadmaker,&#8221; and fabulous stories of his origin and
fortune were circulated. Unknown to himself or to
those nearest to him, men high up in the financial
world kept their eye on the young man&mdash;made no
prophecies&mdash;said nothing&mdash;but were careful for reasons
best known to themselves to help rather than oppose
him when he happened to cross their path. But
the greatest of all their race, Peter Masters himself,
made no sign at all. No fabulous fortune was, however,
gathered in. &#8220;Patrimondi&#8221; paid well, but the
working expenses were great. Christopher made big
returns to the men, not in wages only, but in every
condition of their work. Those in power under him
soon learnt it was better to forget the momentary interests
of the company than the living interests of the
workmen, but in return for his care Christopher did
insist on, and get from his men, an amount of work
that made other employers open their eyes with envious
wonder.</p>
<p>All this time Patricia held her place in his life. It
would have been hard to trace her actual influence on
his daily actions, but it was there, preserving his finer
instincts under the load of material cares, linking him
indissolubly to that world of high Realities which is
every man&#8217;s true inheritance. Yet he made no attempt
to claim her and at times wondered at his own procrastination.
The idea implanted by Peter Masters
bore strange fruit, for even an unconsciously harboured
lie must needs hamper the life behind which it
finds shelter. He could make no advance towards Patricia
while that invidious doubt of his parentage existed,
and he lacked the remorseless courage of Mr.
Aston to inflict pain for however justifiable a cause on
C&aelig;sar. Also perhaps his pride had a word to say.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
If there was a secret, it was theirs, and they had not
chosen to divulge it to him. Again, he had fathomed
something of the depth of the jealous love bestowed
on him, and his own affection and gratitude would
have their say. All and each of these reasons arrayed
themselves against his love. When he tried to face it
first one and then the other weighed heaviest, till at
length he called time to his side and flung himself into
his work the harder to leave that ally free scope. All
of which meant that he was yet but a worshipper at
Love&#8217;s throne, and failed to recognise that his place
was on it.</p>
<p>Christopher was in France when he saw the notice
of Peter Masters&#8217; death in the papers, and he was more
staggered by it than he cared to admit to himself.
The millionaire had been knocked down at a busy
crossing with no more ceremony than would have
served for his poorest workman. He had been carried
to the nearest hospital and died there almost directly,
alone, as he had lived. There was the usual hasty account
of his life, but by some magic that had perhaps
root in Peter&#8217;s own will, no mention was made of his
marriage.</p>
<p>Christopher wrote home on the subject this-wise:</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me the more terrible since I think
he was a man who never believed any such mischance
could dare to happen to him. He always gave me the
impression of one who read his own mortality for
immortality, and was prepared to rule Time as arbitrarily
as he ruled men. It does not look to an outsider
as if he had gained any particular happiness from
his fortune, but happiness is a word everyone spells
in their own way.... I shall be back at the end
of the week, for I find Marcel quite capable of finishing
this piece of work....&#8221;</p>
<p>Such was the epitaph pronounced over Peter Masters
by his own son, and Aymer, reading, sank beneath
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
the dead weight of responsibility that was his.
The outcome of neutrality can be as great a force as
that of action, and to assume the right to stand aside
is to play as decisive a part as the fiercest champion.
Nevertheless he held to that neutral attitude through
the pangs of self-reproach.</p>
<p>There was no will, Mr. Aston told him, when he
returned from the plain business-like affair of the
funeral.</p>
<p>The news, incredible as it was, was yet a respite to
Aymer.</p>
<p>He did not trouble to conceal it.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am certain Saunderson knows something.
Do not count on it, Aymer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I count every chance in my favour,&#8221; returned Aymer
deliberately. &#8220;I discount even your belief that
Peter knew, since he said nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Aston looked at him sadly. He had no such
hope, nor was he even certain he was justified in seconding
C&aelig;sar&#8217;s wish that the fortune should pass
Christopher by. The nearer the great thing came to
them the more difficult was it to ignore the vastness
of the interests involved, and the greater the responsibility
of those who stood motionless between Christopher
and it. Yet Mr. Aston knew as well as Aymer
that neither of them would move from their position,
and if they had acted wrongly in following the wishes
of the dead woman in preference to the material instincts
of the living man, they must accept the result,
and Christopher must accept it, too.</p>
<p>But he felt keenly Aymer&#8217;s failure to present an
unbiassed face to the turn of circumstances.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long will it be before Saunderson acts if he
has any clue to go on?&#8221; Aymer asked wearily after a
long silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;He would act immediately, but whether that would
land him on the right line would depend on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
strength of the clue. Aymer, my dear fellow, try and
put the matter from you. You are not going to act
yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but I&#8217;m no hand at waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was true, and as usual the days of suspense
told heavily on Aymer. Christopher&#8217;s return was an
immense relief. He had had a heavy spell of work
and travelling, and allowed himself a few days&#8217; holiday.
It happened that Patricia was also at Marden.
She spent so large a percentage of her time with Constantia
now that her presence in the house that had been
her home more resembled a visit than Christopher&#8217;s
comings and goings. No one had mentioned the fact
that she was there to him, and he found her in the
drawing-room before dinner kneeling by the fire and
coaxing it into a cheery blaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a regular truant, Patricia,&#8221; he complained
after their greeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Constantia maintains I am at school with her and
calls me truant when I run down here for a few days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you at school? What does she teach you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Subjects too deep for mere man,&#8221; she retorted
lightly. She continued to kneel with her back to him
and the light touched her wonderful hair, that still
seemed too heavy a crown for the proud little head.
It was like molten gold. Christopher felt a new heartache
for the days when he could touch it without fear
in the blind bravery of boyhood. He wanted to see
her face which she so persistently turned from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not sure it is a suitable school for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since when have you become responsible for my
education, sir? Would you prefer my going to school
with Charlotte? You are confounding me with Patrimondi.
You will end by rolling me out flat on a
high-road one day.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was talking arrant nonsense in self-defence, for
every fibre of her being was quivering at his presence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
The old hushed cry awoke in her heart &#8220;Christopher
and Love&mdash;Love and Christopher.&#8221; If she looked at
him he must see it, her eyes must needs betray the
pitiful whisper but for the clamour of foolish words.
Where was Renata? Why were they all so late to-night
of all nights? Yet she had hurried her dressing&mdash;chosen
her gown even, on the chance of this interview
that outmatched her schooled frivolity. The
need to see her face and her eyes again pressed on the
man&mdash;became imperative&mdash;as something of great moment,
strangely difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>At last he abruptly spoke her name.</p>
<p>&#8220;Patricia.&#8221;</p>
<p>She involuntarily turned to him and found what
had appeared so hard was quite easy, for she discerned
some unusual trouble in his mind, and was
woman enough for the mothering instinct to sweep up
over the personal love.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Christopher?&#8221;</p>
<p>He had wit enough to keep his advantage, for there
was something to read on the upturned face that must
not be deciphered in haste.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am seriously worried, Patricia. You might assist
instead of hindering me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is Constantia teaching you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me again,&#8221; she returned with a show of indignation,
&#8220;why on earth should that worry you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like new facets to familiar diamonds,&#8221; he
grumbled obscurely, &#8220;you are getting too old. Patricia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are losing your manners.&#8221; But even under
the banter the colour died from her face and her hand
fell listlessly to her side.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t allow you to be older than I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was saved further embarrassment by Renata&#8217;s
entrance, but all dinner time she was conscious of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
silent &#8220;awareness&#8221; of her and was troubled by it,
and it was a new and unpleasing sensation to be
troubled by any attitude of Christopher&#8217;s. Then his
scrutiny stopped abruptly as if she were suddenly
placed outside his range of vision, and that attitude
suited her mind as poorly as the other.</p>
<p>She hardly knew if it were by her own will or
Christopher&#8217;s that she sat with him and Aymer that
evening. She was quite powerless to resist the request
that might have been a command, and there is
some pain in life that we cling to, dreading its loss
more acutely than its presence.</p>
<p>Mr. Aston was away, a rare occurrence now, and
the three sat talking before the fire, till the dear familiar
intercourse and the peace put to sleep the dull
ache in Patricia&#8217;s heart. They talked&mdash;or rather the
men talked&mdash;of Christopher&#8217;s latest experiences
abroad. He had been to the scene of a vast tunnelling
operation in which his part was to come later.</p>
<p>&#8220;They suggest we should take over their men&#8217;s
shanties as they stand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you?&#8221; demanded C&aelig;sar. These things were
in Christopher&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;They might serve as material,&#8221; he answered drily.
&#8220;Two of their overseers and twenty men asked for
berths with me. They are mostly Italians. If we
keep them to make our encampment, I shall have to
go myself. It is rather odd how these men pick
things up. I heard&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; he broke off abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t,&#8221; remarked C&aelig;sar suggestively after
a minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not much, but it is funny how a nick-name
travels. There were about five hundred men there
still, and I heard one say as I passed,
<ins class="trnote" title="Transcriber&amp;#8217;s Note: changed quote marks from &amp;#8220;Ecco il &amp;#8216;Roadmaker&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221; to correct punctuation inconsistency.">&#8216;Ecco il &#8216;Roadmaker.&#8217;&#8217;&#8221;</ins></p>
<p>He was evidently boyishly pleased at the recognition,
though he did not conclude the sentence. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
man had saluted him as he added to his comrade,
&#8220;C&#8217;&eacute; un maestro d&#8217;uomini, non di brutti.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patricia gave C&aelig;sar a quick look and caught
his answer. It was as if some sudden bond of sympathy
were tied between them.</p>
<p>C&aelig;sar continued skilfully to ply Christopher with
questions and extracted the information that the Patrimondi
Company was much disliked by the big manufacturing
powers.</p>
<p>&#8220;They say we spoil our men, and their own grumble.
They sent me a deputation to ask us to cancel
the Sunday holiday, which they never grant on contract
work, and they feared the result of our example.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you politely agreed?&#8221; suggested C&aelig;sar,
watching Patricia.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told them to&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; again he stopped and laughed;
&#8220;well, Patricia, I told them such was the time-honoured
custom of my country and regretted my inability
to consider their request.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect they only get into mischief on Sunday.&#8221;</p>
<p>C&aelig;sar flung out this with assumed contempt, but
it brought no quick retort. Christopher answered
slowly, with his eyes on the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;We plan excursions for them when there is anything
to see or amusements of some kind. They are
like children. If they are not amused they must needs
make mischief.&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice was rather grave and Aymer knew there
must have been difficulties here of which he did not
mean to speak openly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is deplorable if our Roadmaker is going about
destroying other people&#8217;s comfortable paths. Don&#8217;t
you agree with me, Patricia?&#8221;</p>
<p>She flushed up quickly, grasping his meaning at
once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if their paths encroach on weaker people&#8217;s
rights. I think it&#8217;s just what is wanted.&#8221; Then because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
C&aelig;sar laughed, she realised he was only drawing
her, and flung him an appealing glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we mustn&#8217;t encourage him openly, Patricia,
or he&#8217;ll leave us no old tracks at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m only the humble instrument of a company,&#8221;
protested Christopher. &#8220;I merely carry out the regulations
of my superiors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are entirely at your mercy, you should add.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher disdained to reply to so obvious a fallacy.
Presently, when he had gone to fetch some
drawings to show them, C&aelig;sar said quizzically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he obliterated any of your pet footpaths, Patricia?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Company has great confidence in him,&#8221; he
announced gravely.</p>
<p>She looked straight at him. There was a kind intelligence
in his eyes, and he held out his hand to her.
&#8220;Present company not excepted. But we must not
spoil him, Patricia.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she understood that her secret was Aymer&#8217;s
and it lent her a sense of security and rest to know
it, so that when she went to bed she reproached herself
for her former childish moods. &#8220;I should be
glad his strength of purpose and commonsense are so
great,&#8221; she told herself, forgetting love and commonsense
were ever ill neighbours. &#8220;I am never going
to marry, and it would be difficult to say no to him.
To-night was just one of the best of times that can be
for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>That unwise thought aroused the dull throbbing
ache in her heart again and the reasonable salve she
offered it had no effect. She slept with it, woke with
it, and knew it for the close companion of many days.</p>
<p>But Christopher&#8217;s last thought was, &#8220;I am not
going to do without her any longer, if I am to meet
her any more in this way. I should have read her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
soul again to-night if I had not remembered in
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer Aston lay awake wondering what was the
matter between the two that they did not guess their
palpable secret. He was the richer for another day&#8217;s
respite and every day was a tide carrying him to the
shore of safety.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
</div>
<p>A chilly, rainy mist shrouded the country and
blotted out the familiar beauty. Not a day for walking,
but Christopher had chosen to tramp to a far-off
corner of the estate on some pretence of business
and had come back through the wet, dripping woods,
burr-covered and muddy. He was met in the hall by
a message that Mr. Aymer wanted him at once, so
without waiting to change he strode away, whistling,
to the West Room and came to a standstill on the
threshold, finding Aymer had visitors with him.</p>
<p>There were two gentlemen, one was Mr. Shakleton,
the son and successor of the old solicitor who had
played his part in the finding of Christopher, the
other was a stout, complacent man with gold-rimmed
glasses and scanty sandy hair, and all three of the
occupants of the room looked towards the door as if
waiting for and expecting him. A glance at C&aelig;sar&#8217;s
face brought Christopher swiftly to his side and established
instantly a sense of antagonism with the
visitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want me, C&aelig;sar?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. We want you. Mr. Shakleton you know.
This is Mr. Saunderson.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both men stood up and to Christopher&#8217;s amazement
bowed profoundly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very honoured to meet you,&#8221; said Mr. Saunderson
suavely. &#8220;I hope it will be the commencement
of a long and fruitful acquaintance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher felt rather at a loss to know if the man
meant to be impertinent or was merely being silly.
He looked at C&aelig;sar with the hostile impatience he
felt only too apparent. The hostility but not the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
impatience deepened as he noticed the drawn beaten
look on Aymer&#8217;s face. Also he was uncomfortably
conscious of the three pairs of eyes watching him
with rapt attention. The mild Mr. Shakleton, however,
seemed entirely obscured by the expansive personality
of the bigger man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Confound him,&#8221; thought Christopher, &#8220;has he
never seen burrs on a wet coat before or is my
tie up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Christopher,&#8221; said Aymer, at last, &#8220;come and sit
by me, will you. I think I should like to tell you
myself.&#8221; He looked at Mr. Saunderson as if waiting
permission.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, of course, Mr. Aston. I quite understand.
It is not the sort of news we tell people every
day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher sat on the edge of the sofa with his eyes
fixed on C&aelig;sar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure it won&#8217;t keep,&#8221; he asked abruptly,
&#8220;you look rather tired for business, C&aelig;sar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t keep. It concerns Peter Masters. Mr.
Saunderson says public rumour has underestimated
his fortune rather than exaggerated it. He was worth
nearly three millions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three millions six hundred and forty-one thousand.&#8221;
Mr. Saunderson rolled it out in sonorous tones
after a little smack of his lips that set Christopher&#8217;s
teeth on edge.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems, Christopher,&#8221; Aymer went on, with an
abruptness that did not accord with his opening words,
&#8220;that it&#8217;s yours. You are his heir.&#8221;</p>
<p>He made not the smallest movement or sign by
which the two strangers could gather one passing
glimpse of the agony it cost him to say it, for their
attention was fixed on the younger man. But Christopher
saw nothing else and had thought for nothing
but how soonest to quench that fierce pain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span></p>
<p>The preposterous catastrophe was evidently true,
but surely his own will and wishes were of some
account. He put his hand on Aymer, searching for
words which would not form into sense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take your time, take your time, young man,&#8221;
broke in Mr. Saunderson&#8217;s resonant voice. &#8220;It&#8217;s not
the sort of event a man can be hurried over. You
will grasp it more clearly in a few minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher turned and looked at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I quite grasp the matter,&#8221; he said coolly.
&#8220;Mr. Masters has, with no doubt the kindest meaning
in the world, left his fortune to me. It&#8217;s unfortunate
that I don&#8217;t happen to want all this money. I
couldn&#8217;t possibly do with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Saunderson leant back in his chair with a tolerant
smile as if this were just what he would expect
to hear after the shock, but Aymer bit his lip as if face
to face with some inevitable ill.</p>
<p>Christopher leant towards him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are worrying about it, C&aelig;sar. There can&#8217;t
be any need to say any more now. Of course it&#8217;s out
of the question my accepting it. They can&#8217;t make me
a millionaire against my wishes, I suppose. Anyhow
it&#8217;s a preposterous will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no will,&#8221; began C&aelig;sar and then looked
at the big lawyer, &#8220;tell him,&#8221; he added shortly. Mr.
Saunderson cleared his throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is so. There is no will and the fortune naturally
goes to the next of kin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, then,&#8221; returned Christopher, with blunt
relief. &#8220;I believe he told me once he had a son somewhere.
You had better find him. I don&#8217;t want to deprive
him of his luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the embarrassing silence. Then the big lawyer
got up and bowed solemnly to Christopher.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have found him. Allow me to be the first to
congratulate you, Mr. Masters.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span></p>
<p>Christopher wheeled round on him like a man struck.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; he cried with passionate emphasis. &#8220;C&aelig;sar,
it&#8217;s not true. Tell them so.&#8221;</p>
<p>But C&aelig;sar lay very still and looked past them all,
staring blankly at the opposite wall. It seemed to
Christopher the watching eyes of the others imprisoned
him, held him in subjection. He got up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me out,&#8221; he muttered between his teeth,
though none impeded him. He walked across the
room to the fireplace and stood with his back to them,
his hand mechanically altering the order of a procession
of black elephants that stood there.</p>
<p>Aymer broke the silence, speaking with clear evenness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shakleton, will you take Mr. Saunderson into the
library. You will find my brother there, probably.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, Mr. Aston. Shall I leave these?&#8221; He
indicate the papers on the table before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Leave them where they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Saunderson rose. &#8220;You must not be alarmed,
my dear sir,&#8221; he said in a forced whisper, with a
glance towards Christopher, &#8220;such news often takes a
man off his feet for a while. He&#8217;ll soon appreciate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt. Order anything you like, Shakleton.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were alone at last, yet Christopher did not
move.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christopher, come to me,&#8221; called Aymer quietly.</p>
<p>At that he turned and walked mechanically to the
sofa, seating himself, again with his elbows on his
knees, and his eyes absently fixed on the carpet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you know this before, C&aelig;sar?&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer&#8217;s face twitched. &#8220;Yes, always.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did&mdash;he&mdash;know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, apparently.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did not tell him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher looked up sharply and met his eyes, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
again he forgot his own intimate trouble before the
greater one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, C&aelig;sar,&#8221; he said, dragging up a smile,
&#8220;it would have been far harder at your hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then suddenly he sunk on his knees by Aymer&#8217;s
side, and hid his head against the arm that had sheltered
him as a child.</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t make me take it,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;even
if I am his son. But C&aelig;sar, C&aelig;sar, why didn&#8217;t you
tell me before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hoped you would never know. Did you never
have any suspicion yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never. It was the last thing I should have
imagined.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have never asked me anything. You must
sometimes have wondered about yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was quite content.&#8221; Christopher spoke with
shut teeth. Under no provocation must C&aelig;sar know
the falsehood that had lain so long in his mind. He
saw it in its full proportion now, and hated himself
for his blindness in harbouring so ugly a thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were never certain how much Peter knew and
I&#8217;ve never known for the past three years whether he
meant to claim you or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d only told me, C&aelig;sar!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was my one hope you should not know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve earned that,&#8221; he said reproachfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was myself, not you, I thought of. You&#8217;ve got
to know the whole thing now. Go and sit there in
your old place and don&#8217;t look at me till I&#8217;ve finished.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Aymer at last reached the moment when he must
break the seals of silence&mdash;that expected moment that
had hung over him like some shadowy fate as a foretaste
of judgment, when he must retrace the painful
footsteps of his life across the black gulf from which
he had climbed. But as he turned his face to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
darkness, there was light also on the other side, and
he forgot he had feared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter and I were friends, as you know. He was five
years my senior, but it did not make much difference.
He was a worker, just as I was a player. He had tremendous
capabilities and he put all his big brain into
his work and when he wanted change he came to me.
I represented to him the reverse side of his strenuous
life and he was oddly fond of me. Before he was
thirty he had well started his fortune as he raced to
wealth. I raced to ruin and found every inch of the
road made easy for me. Peter came into conflict with
the socialistic party. There was a certain James Hibbault,
who was a great power, and Peter, who was not
so heavy a power in those days, employed the wisdom
of the serpent to crush him. He came up to London
and offered me a chance of new amusement in abetting
his plans. The Hibbaults were middle class people
without middle class virtues. They lived a scrambling,
noisy life propagating their crude ideas and
sowing broadcast the seeds of a greater power than
they knew. They were, however, a real force to be
reckoned with, they and their party, because of certain
truths hidden in their wildest creeds&mdash;truths which
did not suit Peter&#8217;s creed in the least. He made their
acquaintance, and he introduced me to them. They
were sufficiently new to amuse me, but I should have
probably have tired of them soon had it not been for
your mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused a moment. &#8220;Do you remember her,
Christopher?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elizabeth Hibbault,&#8221; went on Aymer slowly,
&#8220;was extraordinarily beautiful, with the beauty of
grace rather than of feature. She was as distinct
from the rest of her clamorous family as a pearl from
pebbles. She was an enthusiast, a dreamer, passionately
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
sincere, passionately pitiful. She recognised
truth as a water diviner finds water. She was brought
up in a labyrinth of theories, creeds of equality, in
hatred for the rich, and out of all the jargon she gathered
some eternal truths which she made her own.
She did not live with her people: she had rooms of
her own and she was a black-and-white artist. But
she was often at the Hibbaults. Peter probably knew
her accustomed days. She used to speak of her faiths.
It was like one note of gold in the discordant babble.
Men came and listened to her and she never knew it
was not for her words but for her magnetic wonderful
unknown self that they came. She might, and probably
did, impress men who were dreamers or fanatics
already, but those to whom all her beliefs were childish
nonsense went just the same, Peter and I with
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped a moment and shot a glance at Christopher,
who never moved.</p>
<p>&#8220;I lost my interest in Peter&#8217;s schemes and he ceased
to explain them to me, but I still visited Elizabeth
at her own rooms when I was allowed. She was very
anxious to convert Peter and myself, more especially
Peter. I was not in love with her, Christopher, yet,
but she fascinated me. I speculated as to how it would
be with her if all the fire and devotion she brought
to a mere Cause were turned into a more personal
direction. She paid more attention to Peter than to
myself, and she evidently considered him a more desirable
convert. One evening we went together to
call on her and they fell into the usual line of discussion,
he answering her in a tolerant amused way as
if she were a precocious child. I stayed behind when
he left and she walked up and down in restless agitation,
half forgetful of me. &#8216;The personality of the
man!&#8217; she cried fiercely, &#8216;he is too strong, he is ruthless!
One cannot escape him. I cannot get him out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
of my head.&#8217; I told her she had much better tackle
me. She told me plainly that I was a negative force
in the world and my cousin an active. That was
enough for me. I thought she despised me and I
vowed she should recognise my possibilities as well as
Peter&#8217;s. If any man were to turn the passionate stream
of her nature back on herself, or to love&mdash;to see the
woman rise above the fanatic&mdash;it should be I, not
Peter. But I said nothing of this to him. I do not
think he ever knew it at all. It began in pique on my
side, then jealousy, lastly passion. Christopher, if I
had loved her from the first beginning of things I
should not be ashamed to meet your eyes now. Don&#8217;t
look round yet. I laid deliberate siege to her heart
and found she possessed my mind night and day. Soon
it was not Peter who was my rival, but her own soul.
I was confident I should win, though Peter, it was
clear, was also wooing her persistently. He at least
meant her well, Christopher. He loved her in his uncomprehending
way, wanting her for the woman she
was <i>not</i>&mdash;except in his mind. And I&mdash;I wanted her
for the outward woman she was.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused long enough for his listener to face
clearly the portrait of the worn, broken woman he
remembered, the outward woman that bore no likeness
to the clear knowledge of the inner soul.</p>
<p>Aymer continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;At last I felt it was time to end it. Peter had
been in town some time then. I knew the senior Hibbault
and he were coming to some understanding, but
I guessed nothing of the nature of it. She never mentioned
him to me at this time. She stood, poor girl,
between the two of us like a trapped creature, and because
she feared herself and neither of us, she overstepped
one snare to fall into the other. Christopher,
I don&#8217;t know what was in my mind when I went to
her that last evening: I had not seen her for some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
days, but when I stood before her I knew suddenly I
loved her, and then, like a flash, I saw it was neither
Peter nor her that stood between us, but my own evil
self. I told her all&mdash;that she was the victor and I the
conquered. I was proud of my new humbleness. For
once I recognised myself and my true place in the order
of the world. But she knew me better than I guessed,
and she was afraid to tell me the truth. She put me
off with gentle words, terrified lest I should guess before
I left her&mdash;Don&#8217;t turn away, Christopher&mdash;At
last she owned she had written me a letter and I should
find it when I got back. Her attitude maddened me.
The better self, if it ever existed, got stamped out.
I told her nothing should come between us, that nothing
short of death should keep me from her, while I
could move hand or foot.&#8221;</p>
<p>The white scar on Aymer&#8217;s forehead was very plain
and his face had grown thin and sharp. Christopher
for the first time looked up at him and away again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I went home at last, Christopher, wild to get this
mysterious letter to which she would refer me. I
went back and took seven devils with me&mdash;my passion
and love fighting for possession. Nevil and I had a
room of our own on the ground floor. I think they
use it for storing papers in now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher gave a slight movement: he knew that
well.</p>
<p>&#8220;I went straight in, knowing any letter for me
would be taken there. Nevil was going upstairs as I
crossed the hall and he called to me across the banisters
that Wayband had sent back my revolver and
he had opened it. Revolver shooting was a passion
just then and I was accounted a crack shot. I answered
him savagely and went on. The letter lay on
the table. She had been married to Peter two days
before at a Registrar&#8217;s office. I felt I must have
known it from eternity, but it caught me on the crest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
of my fury, it overwhelmed me in a torrent of mad
shame and wild jealousy. I had failed&mdash;had been
beaten at my own game&mdash;beaten and fooled by some
God who had used my passion for his own ends.
Those short minutes of purer love burnt my soul like
fire till I raged at my folly. Christopher, I&#8217;d give all
I have left to say I was mad. I wasn&#8217;t. I knew what
I was doing. The revolver lay there on the table and
an open box of cartridges by it. It was the coward&#8217;s
way out of the agony, and I took it. I shot myself&mdash;the
crack shot of Waybands Club missed his own life
by a hair&#8217;s-breadth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even then, after the long years, Christopher caught
an echo of bitterness in the voice. He dully wondered
at his own inability to move or speak or send
out a thought of consolation to the man who had suffered
so fiercely.</p>
<p>Aymer gave a little gasp and was still a moment
Then he went on:</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all my story, Christopher. Now comes
your mother&#8217;s part of it. The first result of her marriage
was that the Hibbaults&#8217; name ceased to be a
power for the Socialist party&mdash;became less than a
power. James Hibbault severed his connection with
them entirely. I think Peter gave him a place at one
of his big affairs. He had bought them out, and for a
time the party fell into disrepute. But Elizabeth,
whom he had married, he had not bought. I think she
believed she had and could influence him, that she
could sway him without loss of her own being. I
know she clung to her true personality with passionate
strength. I had failed to break it down, but I
think Peter failed here also. When she heard of her
father&#8217;s and brother&#8217;s betrayal of their party&mdash;it was
nothing else&mdash;she was nearly crazy with grief. It was
some time before Peter could get her to acknowledge
their marriage at all, and she never, I believe, spoke
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
of her people again. But at last he got her to Stormly.
I know very little of what happened there. I believe
he was willing she should play Lady Bountiful to his
people if it pleased her&mdash;even made her a big allowance
for the purpose. But she went amongst them
and she would have none of it. She would make no
compromise with what she regarded as wholly evil.
She found Peter had only played with her regarding
her creed&mdash;that he never had the least intention of
altering his plan of life to suit it. She hated it all a
hundredfold more than you did, Christopher, and the
thought of bringing a child into an atmosphere that
was rank poison to her, became a nightmare. Perhaps
she was not wholly accountable then&mdash;there was
no woman to stand by her or counsel patience. Anyhow,
about six weeks before you were born, we believe
she just disappeared. No one knows how Peter really
felt about it. In the face of the world he shrugged
his shoulders and went on with his life as if wife and
expected child had never been. We suppose he tried
to find her at first, but he always declared there was
no need&mdash;she would come back when she had had
enough of the world. Eventually a letter reached him
saying you had come into the world and that, rather
than put you under the power of your father and all
he stood for, she would bring you up among the people
she loved and pitied. My father tried all he could to
make Peter seriously seek for his wife. We know now
he had some false clue and that he believed she and
you were living in Liverpool. But either from pride
or indifference he would never see for himself these
two whose fortunes he watched so closely. Saunderson
tells me it was the younger Hibbault who supplied
him with the false clue and found it to his advantage
to keep up the fraud. They can&#8217;t trace either Hibbault
now. They seem to have emigrated. My father
once visited Peter, before Elizabeth left him. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
was some dispute at the works and a certain foreman
named Felton protested against his orders. My father
heard the interview between them, and the man made
a strong appeal to him. He did his best as go-between
and failed. Peter did not quarrel about it. He was
just immovable in his heavy way, but your mother
was greatly troubled over the whole business and was
generously good to Felton and his wife in the face
of Peter&#8217;s direct commands. Ten years afterwards
this man, tramping from Portsmouth to London in
search of work, met your mother again. He was
evidently a man of strong memory, and he knew her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher nodded. He remembered the little narrow
paths in the tiny garden, the smell of the box
edging, a pink cabbage rose that fell when the man&#8217;s
sleeve brushed against it. The man and his mother
had talked long and the old woman had asked him if
he knew the man. The next day they were on the
road again and he had felt a resentment towards this
man as the cause. All these recollections crowded
themselves into his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Felton seems to have been a man with some
strength of character. He had easily promised your
mother not to betray her existence to her husband, but
the memory of her face and some uneasy sense of
unfitness troubled him, I suppose. He remembered
Mr. Aston, who had spoken for him, and that he was
something to do with these people. He turned up here
one day and Nevil had the sense to send him direct
to us in London. It was just at the time when I was
wanting to adopt a child. I had stopped cursing fate
and myself, and I wanted something of my own almost
as fiercely as I wanted my freedom.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was another long pause. This time Christopher
put out his hand and laid it on Aymer&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t any more. We followed up the clue
and found you. My father made another appeal to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
Peter on behalf of his unknown son, and Peter declared
the subject was not discussable: so I kept you.
I vowed I&#8217;d never stand between your own father and
you, but also that I&#8217;d never put out a hand to bring
you together. That visit you paid him, Christopher,
was the blackest time I&#8217;ve had since the day I realised
what I&#8217;d done. I thought I had got over my jealousy,
and I had not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher leant over him and gripped his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;C&aelig;sar,&#8221; he said in a breathless low voice, looking
him straight in the eyes. &#8220;C&aelig;sar, there was no need
of that then&mdash;there never has been, nor could be. I
have no father at all if it be not you.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
</div>
<p>&#8220;It does not seem to me a very great thing to ask in
the face of things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Saunderson dangled his eyeglasses and regarded
Christopher with a dubious air.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want three days to consider the matter,&#8221; continued
Christopher impatiently. &#8220;Where is the difficulty?
You don&#8217;t seem to remember you are asking
me to give up my chosen life and work and take on a
job that I loathe.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Mr. Saunderson&#8217;s face had been capable of expressing
more than displeasure, it would have done so,
but he was of no plastic build, mind or body, and
&#8220;displeasure&#8221; was the nearest he could get to active
anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a singular way of regarding what most
men would think overpowering good luck, Mr. Masters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher turned sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;You at least cannot compel me to take that name.
It has never been mine and never will be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gently, gently, young man. I am willing to make
every allowance for your perturbation, but really, in
speaking of my late client ...&#8221; he stopped with
a shake of the head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was speaking of a name, not of him, Mr. Saunderson.
However, I apologise. Once more, will you
let the whole matter stand still for three days. I
don&#8217;t mean to accept the thing, you know, but I
can&#8217;t argue it out now. I will meet you in town on
Wednesday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you insist, there is nothing more to be said of
course,&#8221; returned Mr. Saunderson, huffily. &#8220;As to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
your refusing your own rights, that will be less simple
than you imagine, but I shall hope you will soon view
the matter in another light.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no provision made in case the inheritor
should refuse or not be available?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher confronted him suddenly with the question,
and the poor man, who was as completely off his
balance by Christopher&#8217;s incomprehensible reception
of his tidings, as that young man himself, was evidently
confused.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were no instructions at all beyond the memorandum
stating his wife and child were last heard of
in Whitmansworth Union.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But in the former will, which you say was destroyed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not at liberty to divulge anything that might
be contained in that document.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing to prevent your acting on such
instructions at your own prompting,&#8221; Christopher insisted
bluntly.</p>
<p>Mr. Saunderson looked at him critically. &#8220;That
is an ingenious suggestion Mr. ...&#8221; he paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aston,&#8221; said Christopher. &#8220;It&#8217;s the name those
who have treated me as a son gave me, and I see no
obligation to change it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawyer rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we are to defer further discussion till
Wednesday?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Until Wednesday. In town, not here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He left with Mr. Shakleton in his wake, and Christopher
was at last alone and free to weigh if he would
the weight of this <ins class="trnote" title="Transcriber&amp;#8217;s Note: stupenduous in original text">stupendous</ins> burden, which he resolutely
decided was not his to bear. He stood looking
out of the window at the still driving mist and had to
drag his thoughts back from the external aspect of
things to the inner matters he must face. But there
was no lucidity in his mind, nothing was clear to him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
but his fierce resentment against the dead man, and a
passionate pity for a faded woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the beauty of grace rather than feature....&#8221;
He was stung with intolerable shame
for the manhood he must share with one who had
wrought such havoc in the woman he was most bound
to protect from herself, as well as from the world. The
risks and chances of those early days flickered before
him. He had been abandoned to such for some vague
ultimate good to the colossal idea of fortune which
neither he nor its late possessor could spend. Was he
more bound to take it and its cares to himself than its
author was bound to care for his own flesh and blood?
Anger clouded his reason and he knew it. Yet if he
could not think coherently on the matter, of what use
were the three days of grace he had claimed? He
could not endure company at present, and the four
walls of his room were as a prison. At last he sent a
hasty message to the motor house, tossed a few necessaries
into a bag and wrote a note to C&aelig;sar. &#8220;Dear
C&aelig;sar, I&#8217;ve got to make up my mind about this and
I must do it alone, so to come to some decision I&#8217;m
going off in the car. I&#8217;ll be back when I&#8217;ve got the
thing straight in my mind. Tell St. Michael and
Nevil about it, but if you can help it don&#8217;t let anyone
else know.&mdash;Christopher Aston.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drove slowly down the drive, out into the highroad
and, turning westward, sped away into the misty
distance.</p>
<p>A great stillness fell on Aymer when Christopher
left him. He had lived so long under the shadowy
fear of the thing that had now happened, that it was
hard to credit the fear had passed in fulfilment. He
had been forced back to face the past, and, behold, the
terror of it was gone. He could only measure the full
value of the effort he had made by the languor and
listlessness that now wrapped him round, as a child
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
who had overtaxed his strength and must needs rest.
A hazy doubt crept into his mind as to what it was he
had so dreaded&mdash;the resuscitation of the past, or
Christopher&#8217;s reception of it. In either case the fear
had faded as some phantom form that melted in daylight.</p>
<p>He stumbled on one thought with vague wonder.
No barrier had been raised between him and his
adopted son: instead he found the only barrier had
been erected by his own lack of strength to face that
truth until the inexorable hand of God forced him to
the issue.</p>
<p>As to the future he recognised that might be left to
Christopher, whose whole life, since Aymer took him,
had been a preparation for this situation. His long
struggle to keep a grip on life was ebbing fast, it was
good to leave decisions in another&#8217;s hands, to rest, and
accept.</p>
<p>When Mr. Aston returned C&aelig;sar gave him Christopher&#8217;s
note with a brief remark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Saunderson has been.&#8221;</p>
<p>The note, short as it was, told the rest. Mr. Aston
looked anxiously at his son, but Aymer met his eyes
with a quiet smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you were away, St. Michael. You&#8217;ve
had enough to contend with, and there was no need.
There is nothing for either of us to do. It&#8217;s Christopher&#8217;s
affair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Aston looked at the note again and reread the
signature, then he gave it back, satisfied.</p>
<p>&#8220;What will happen if he won&#8217;t accept it?&#8221; he questioned
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is for him to decide.&#8221; Aymer&#8217;s tone was earnestly
emphatic. &#8220;Father, we&#8217;ve done our part. We
can&#8217;t alter it if we would. Leave him free.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the crown of your success that you can do so,
my dear old fellow.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The coronation has not taken place yet,&#8221; returned
C&aelig;sar, with a touch of dry humour that reassured
his father more than any words that all was well with
his son.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Meanwhile, hour after hour, Christopher&#8217;s car raced
over the white roads. The twinkling lights in the villages
through which he sped grew fewer and at last
ceased. A more solid blackness was the only inkling
of dwellings on either hand. Once the low, vibrating
hum of the car seemed to bring a light to a high window,
but it fell back into the dark before he had
caught more than a faint glimmer on the blind.</p>
<p>He met nothing: the road for all he knew was utterly
empty of life. In the silent, motionless darkness
it was like a path into illimitable space. He knew
every mile of it, yet in the night the miles stretched
out and raced with him.</p>
<p>It was far from village or town when at last Christopher
wrenched his mind from the mechanical power
that held it prisoner, and realised that town or no
town, bed or no bed, he must stop. He brought the
car to a standstill under the lea of a low ridge of
downs, at a point where an old chalk pit reared its
white face, glimmering faintly in the darkness. He
hazarded a fair guess as to his whereabouts. Whitmansworth
must be fifteen or twenty miles ahead. It
was nearly midnight now. He would get no lodging
even if he went on. He backed the car off the road
into the circle of the chalk pit, made as comfortable a
resting place as he could with rugs and cushions between
the motor and the white wall, and extinguished
the lamps. The cool, still night had him to herself,
and cradled him to sleep as a mother her child, under
the folds of her dark mantle.</p>
<p>He woke when the first fingers of dawn busied
themselves with the hem of that dusky cloak, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
sound as faint and tremulous as the light itself whispered
across the earth. He watched a while to see the
dim shapes reform under the glowing light, and the
clouds that still curtained the sky, take on themselves
a sombre grey uniform. But directly the line of white
road took distinctness Christopher struck camp, and
boldly raced to meet the full day. An early shepherd
paused to watch him pass, returning impassively to
work as he disappeared. Two or three labouring men
also stared; one even commented to a fellow worker
that &#8220;these yere motors take no more heed o&#8217; decent
hours than o&#8217; natural distances. Five in the mornin&#8217;
weren&#8217;t part o&#8217; the gentry&#8217;s day when I were a boy,&#8221;
he grumbled, &#8220;and five miles were five miles, no more
nor less. &#8216;Tisn&#8217;t more nor a mile now.&#8221;</p>
<p>At wayside farms life was in full swing. Dumbly
impatient cows listened for the clatter of milk-pails,
and solemn cart horses trudged to the upland fields.
Presently he passed through a town where his own
Patrimondi made pleasant, easy going. The town
servants were cleaning the smooth, elastic surface with
big jets of water. Christopher went slowly by with
an eye on his handiwork. He fancied he saw a small
defect at a turn and stopped to examine it. An indignant
worker told him brusquely he needn&#8217;t try to
pick holes in their roads because there weren&#8217;t any,
and Christopher returned meekly he thought they
looked good, but fancied the mark he examined was a
flaw.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t any business of yours, anyway,&#8221; was the
angry retort, &#8220;the men who laid this knew what they
was a-doin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another man had joined him who had worked on
the new road when Christopher was to and fro there,
and recognised him. He plucked the other by the
sleeve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up, you fool,&#8221; he growled, though not so low
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
but Christopher heard him. &#8220;It&#8217;s the Roadmaker
himself. Mornin&#8217;, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher gave him a few words of recognition
and went on.</p>
<p>The slate roofs of Whitmansworth came into sight
as the church clock struck six. He could see the white
Union House high on the hill to the left, but he had no
mind to halt there. He stopped the car at the gate of
the town cemetery. It was not a beautiful place. Just
a little square field with an avenue of young trees and
an orderly row of green mounds and haphazard monuments,
but in one corner amongst a row of unmarked
graves was a white cross. &#8220;In remembrance of my
mother,&#8221; was the sole inscription it bore. Christopher
stood and looked at it gravely. The thought of another
grave amongst the family tombs in the trim
churchyard at Stormly crossed his mind. It was
better here in the little, plain unpretentious cemetery
amongst the very poor whose sorrows she had made
her own. She would sleep more quietly so.</p>
<p>But he found no message from her here, nor had he
expected it. Her actual presence had not consecrated
the spot for him, and he was impatient to gain the
road made sacred by reason of the tired, failing footsteps
that made their last effort there: the Via Dolorosa
of his mother&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>He passed the milestone where he had waited for
his fortune fifteen years ago, and saw it in his mind&#8217;s
eye hastening towards him from the east in the person
of Charles Aston. That was the <i>true</i> Fortune,&mdash;this
spurious thing they were trying to harness to his back
was evil to the core. Had not that been the very
meaning of those painful steps that had struggled
away from it along this very road&mdash;the meaning of the
lonely grave amongst the broken-down poor of Whitmansworth
Union?</p>
<p>He stopped the car near a little bridge where a thin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
brooklet made a noisy chatter, and sat still, his chin on
his hand, thinking deeply.</p>
<p>This was the spot for which he had raced all these
hours, for here he and she had rested that terrible night
to gather strength for the last mile that lay between
the woman and rest.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s better to be tired and hungry oneself, Jim,
than to make other people so. Don&#8217;t forget that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not really tired,&#8221; the child maintained
stoutly, &#8220;but it&#8217;s going to rain again. Can&#8217;t you come
on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Presently.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think it is the right road?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Jim. I was sure of it at first, but
I&#8217;m sure of nothing now.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The words and scene were as clear to him as the day
they happened. He saw in it now a deeper significance,
a possible meaning that was the last note of
tragedy to his mother&#8217;s story. For that note is
reached only when the faith in which we have lived,
acted and endured, fails us. That is the bitterness and
foretaste of death. Then only can the shadow of it
fall on us, and in great mercy gather us into its shade.</p>
<p>The Right Road! There was no doubt or shadow
for Christopher yet. He had taken the first step on
the Road he had chosen, and he would not look back.
He would not stultify his mother&#8217;s sacrifice. Such
faint echoes as he heard calling him back were temptations
to which he must turn a deaf ear. He would
go forward on his chosen path, and Peter Masters&#8217;
millions must look after themselves.</p>
<p>That was the final decision. Yet he sat there, still
figuring the persons of the woman and the child trudging
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
down the road towards him, and as he gazed,
without conscious effort, the forms changed. The
boy grew to manhood: the woman took to herself
youth, youth with a crown of golden hair and the form
of Patricia.</p>
<p>A throb of exultation leapt through him. Here
were the real riches and fulness of life within his grasp
and he, in blunt stupidity, had not chosen to see, had
set material good and vague uncertainties before his
own incomparable gain and happiness. Whatever had
held him back before, the clouded life or personal ambition,
or C&aelig;sar&#8217;s need, it was swept away now like
some low-lying mist before the wind, and left the clear
vision, the man and the woman together on the long,
smooth Road he would lay for her tender feet.</p>
<p>There should be no more delay than the needed time
to race from here to her. Twenty-five miles of country
that his car was eager to devour. He slipped
away swiftly from the past as he had done before on
this very road&mdash;to a new future.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
</div>
<p>Patricia sat by the fire in her little sitting-room seeking
for a plausible excuse to return to Constantia as
soon as might be. The grey weather, the strange sense
of impending events weighed on her, she knew. She
was in the mood when the old evil might flash up
again, and for this reason she kept away from her
sister a while, hoping to nurse herself into a better mind
before evening. Christopher had gone again in his
usual abrupt way. Presumably C&aelig;sar understood, but
she found herself wishing she also held his confidence.
She was hungry for a repetition of that first evening
as a starved child is hungry for a crust, when the better
things seem as far away as heaven. She must go
back to Constantia when she could frame a suitable
reason for her capricious movements. She was much
safer there, beside the considerate friend, who kept the
surface of life in a pleasant ripple, and never seemed
to look into the depths or ask her what she found there
to trouble her, as dear little sympathetic Renata did
occasionally. Yet how could she go if Christopher
were really coming back to-day, as St. Michael said,
and the future held any possibility of another golden
hour? The force of her deep love turned back on herself,
broke through spirit and heart and let loose in her
mind strange imaginings, alternate glimpses of a
heaven or hell that had no relationship with tradition.
She put her hands over her face and kept quite still
in the grip of a sudden agony that made her physically
cold and faint and exhausted. It would pass as
it had passed before, yet was she forever to be at the
mercy of this torturing realisation of empty years and
eternal loss? Did Christopher love her or not? The
assured &#8220;yes&#8221; and the positive &#8220;no&#8221; were as two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
shuttlecocks tossed over her strained mind by the
breath of circumstance. Her own erroneous idea that
her still unconquered passion kept them apart was
breeding morbid misery for her, as all false beliefs
must do. She had kept herself under control to-day
by dint of isolation, and the inadequacy of that course
filled her with self-contempt. In her solitary fight
against the life forces within and without, she was getting
worsted. She knew she resisted the invasion of
their hours of depression with less courage than of
old. It did not seem to matter so greatly if there were
nothing to be won from life, and she was very tired.
It had been a mistake to come to Marden at all, there
was too much time to think there. She returned to
that fact eventually. The afternoon wore on and she
fell into a lethargy with no desire to escape it, and did
not hear Christopher&#8217;s motor arrive.</p>
<p>Christopher for once paused in the hall, instead of
going straight to Aymer&#8217;s room, as was the invariable
rule, after even a day&#8217;s absence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Mrs. Aston?&#8221; he asked the footman,
who replied vaguely, when Renata herself appeared.
But it was not Renata that Christopher wanted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Patricia?&#8221; he questioned with more
truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Upstairs in her room, I think. She seems rather
worried and tired, Christopher. Do you want her?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a note of anxiety in Renata&#8217;s gentle
voice. She was always nervous and anxious if she
fancied Patricia was worried, struggling to stand between
her and the petty annoyances which were supposed
to be so irresistibly maddening to a true Connell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I want her.&#8221; He smiled as he said it. &#8220;But
I&#8217;ll go to her. Don&#8217;t trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went upstairs two steps at a time, and along the
familiar corridor, and outside the door paused for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
first moment since he had seen his vision on the highroad.</p>
<p>The corridor was already dark, but when he entered
in obedience to her languid &#8220;Come in,&#8221; the fire light
made a rosy glow and filled the quiet space with tremulous
light.</p>
<p>Patricia sat facing the fire, with her back to the
door. He could see her golden head over the back
of the chair, and his heart beat quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I come and talk to you, Patricia?&#8221;</p>
<p>For the moment she did not answer or move. She
was almost in doubt if she could accept his presence
just now, until he was actually standing on the rug
before her, looking down at her with keen, searching
eyes, before which all her wild thoughts sunk back
into oblivion, and a sense of quiet content and security
stole over her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you been doing?&#8221; he demanded.
&#8220;You look very tired.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The result of laziness,&#8221; she rejoined, and then
was angry with herself for allowing an opening for
mere trivialities.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s not true, Christopher. It&#8217;s a bad day
with me. I&#8217;m afraid to face anyone, even my own
maid.&#8221;</p>
<p>With no one else in the world could she have
owned so much, and the keen pleasure of exercising
her right to open dealing with him, outweighed the
humiliation of her avowal.</p>
<p>Christopher seemed intent on his own affairs, however,
for he asked her abruptly if St. Michael or C&aelig;sar
had told her the news.</p>
<p>&#8220;What news?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something rather disconcerting has happened to
me,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll tell you that presently.
The most important thing now is that I want to get
married.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span></p>
<p>All the cold waters of the world closed over her
head for a moment. It was as if he had wrenched a
plank from one drowning. She answered him, however,
in a low, mechanical voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;Soon, Christopher?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will be for her to say, if she will have me
at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have not asked her yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am asking her.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up at him, puzzled and incredulous of
the apparent meaning. Then suddenly he was on his
knees by her side, with his strong arms round her.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear, my dear, surely you must know. Is
there need for any words between us? I&#8217;ve known
so long all you must mean to me. Listen, Patricia,
you will have to forgive me a great thing. I&#8217;ve let
outside considerations, absurd ambitions, and the
shadow of a lie, stand between us. I&#8217;ve waited when
I should have spoken. You <i>will</i> forgive me that, my
dear one, will you not? I&#8217;m not humble a bit in asking.
I am so proud of the one great thing, that <i>I</i> can
give you, Love,&mdash;can hold you and wrap you in it, so
that nothing can hurt you any more. You understand,
you recognise my right, Patricia?&#8221;</p>
<p>She could say nothing, understand nothing, but the
great peace of perfect security. She let him hold her
still, with her head against his shoulder and his dear
face near, so near she seemed to lose sense of her own
identity. All the answer to her life&#8217;s riddle lay there,
behind the love that emptied her soul of need. Out of
the blissful unspeakable light some words vibrated
into new meaning.</p>
<p>&#8220;There shall be no more sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>It meant this then, this experience that was theirs.
For him and her there was no more tempest, no more
restless craving or peril, all had passed with the old
incompleteness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span></p>
<p>Still, she had not spoken audibly to him nor had he
pressed her to do so. Words were too imperfect a
medium. But presently, when all had been said in the
silence that could be said, he touched her hair with
caressing hand and reminded her:</p>
<p>&#8220;You have never answered me, sweet.&#8221;</p>
<p>She put her hand on his as it held her and whispered,
&#8220;Have I not, Christopher?&#8221;</p>
<p>And then he kissed her.</p>
<p>Afterwards as they sat watching the red fire, it
seemed to her there was no problem in all the world
he could not solve, no struggle in which he would not
prove victor, nor any knowledge too deep to reach. In
the illumination of their great love the gates of life
became visible and open, never to be quite closed again.</p>
<p>She spoke at last slowly and quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christopher, I am not going to ask you if you are
afraid or have counted the risk you run, I being what
I am. I know what you would say and I love you so
well that now at this moment I have no fear either.
But it will come nevertheless. Others will point out
to you that it is a mad thing to do, and I shall say it
too. It is then you must hold me, Christopher, against
my will and against myself. For this is my clear sane
hour, when I really know, and I know it means my
salvation. Only when that certainty slips from me
you must keep and save me yourself, dearest.&#8221;</p>
<p>He held her hands against him and looked down into
her eyes. &#8220;As I would keep and save myself, beloved.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled a little, understanding to the finest shade
his meaning, and then a quiver of weakness touched
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should die if you let me slip, Christopher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going to live,&#8221; he said firmly, and kissed
her again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
</div>
<p>Christopher entirely forgot to tell Patricia of his
fortune or parentage. He remembered that little
omission as he went down to dinner and looked back
to see if she were visible, but she was not in sight,
and as he was already late he had to go in without her.</p>
<p>She came down still later, looking so beautiful with
such a touch of warm colour in her face, and so sweet
a light of wonder in her eyes that even Nevil regarded
her with speculative interest.</p>
<p>Aymer had long given up dining with them, and no
one spoke of the lawyers&#8217; visit or of Christopher&#8217;s
rapid flittings, or indeed of any of the subjects on
which their minds were really intent. But there
seemed a tacit understanding amongst them that dinner
must not be a long affair and was a prelude to
something yet to happen.</p>
<p>They went out together and Christopher delayed
Patricia in the hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must see Nevil and C&aelig;sar and tell them at once,&#8221;
he said hurriedly, &#8220;then I want you, my dearest. I&#8217;ve
news for you, which I forgot just now. You must
know it, though it makes no difference to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil came out at that moment and she slipped
away after Renata with curiosity wide awake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I to congratulate you as a millionaire or commiserate
with you as a bearer of burdens, old fellow?&#8221;
asked Nevil, flinging himself into a big chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will congratulate me, I hope, but not about
that confounded money though. Nevil, you are Patricia&#8217;s
guardian. Will you and Renata give her to
me?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span></p>
<p>He spoke abruptly and without any preamble, gripping
the back of a chair in his hands. A sudden doubt
as to the family acceptance of what was an unquestionable
matter in his eyes suddenly assailed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to marry Patricia?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher nodded. &#8220;You can hardly urge we
have not had time to know our own minds,&#8221; he said,
smiling a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Nevil admitted, and then added rather distractedly,
&#8220;What ought I to urge, though, Christopher?
Of course it&#8217;s the greatest possible thing that
could happen to Patricia, but for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m appealing to Patricia&#8217;s guardian, who has only
her interests to consider. I&#8217;ll look after my own.
However,&#8221; he went on hastily, &#8220;it&#8217;s only fair to tell
you, Nevil, I don&#8217;t mean to take either the fortune or
the name. So long as you&#8217;ll lend me your own I&#8217;ll
stick to it. Failing that, my mother&#8217;s will serve me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil made no comment beyond a nod. The
younger man waited with what patience he could command.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does it seriously affect the matter?&#8221; he asked at
last, &#8220;my refusing the beastly money?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil got up slowly and shook himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;It affects Patricia&#8217;s guardians not one bit. It&#8217;s
not as if it were that, or nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ve enough. Of course if I hadn&#8217;t I might
feel differently about it. I can keep her in comfort,
Nevil.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevil got up deliberately and altered the position
of a bronze on the high mantelshelf.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not Patricia I&#8217;m thinking about,&#8221; he said in
his slow way, &#8220;but hang it all, you belong to us,
Christopher. We must think of you! Have you
counted the risks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I probably understand them better than anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I dismiss further responsibility. I&#8217;m really
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
more pleased than I can say, Christopher. Poor little
Patricia! What fortune for <ins class="trnote" title="Transcriber&amp;#8217;s Note: added double quote mark">her!&#8221;</ins></p>
<p>&#8220;You clearly understand there won&#8217;t be any fortune?&#8221;
persisted the other bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Peter&#8217;s fortune? Of course not. Where&#8217;s
the obligation? I&#8217;ll go and tell Renata.&#8221;</p>
<p>He strolled off and Christopher hurried to the West
Room, where he found Aymer and Mr. Aston waiting
expectantly. Christopher came to a standstill by the
fireplace and to his amazement found his hands shaking.
He had never imagined there would be any difficulty
in this interview, yet he found himself unaccountably
at a loss before these two men. The absurdly
inadequate idea that they might consider it unjustifiable
greed in him to grasp so great a prize as
Patricia Connell when they had already given him so
much assailed him.</p>
<p>Both men were aware of his unusual embarrassment
and neither of them made the slightest attempt to help
him out, for Mr. Aston had a very fair idea of what
had happened, and had conveyed his suspicions to Aymer.
They both found a certain amusing fascination
in seeing how he would deal with the situation, and it
was a situation so pleasing to them both that they
failed to realise it might present real difficulties to
him.</p>
<p>He faced them suddenly, and plunged into the matter
in his usual direct way.</p>
<p>&#8220;C&aelig;sar and St. Michael, I&#8217;ve something to tell you
both. I am not sure if it will be news to you or not,
but Patricia has said she will marry me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He came to an abrupt stop, and turned away again
towards the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very good news,&#8221; said Mr. Aston quietly, &#8220;if
in no way surprising.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m asking too much when I&#8217;ve
had so much given me? I feel abominably greedy.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You might think of me in the matter,&#8221; protested
Aymer, plaintively. &#8220;What on earth does it matter if
you are greedy so long as you provide me with a real
interest in life. I began to think you meant to defraud
me of my clear rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>A very grateful Christopher crossed the room and
took his usual seat on the sofa.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been a blind idiot,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;or rather
an idle one. I&#8217;ve known for years it must be Patricia,
and left it at that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; demanded Aymer.</p>
<p>But that he could not or would not tell them.</p>
<p>Mr. Aston then suggested Christopher should explain
what he meant to do concerning his inheritance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which you have treated so far with scandalous
disrespect,&#8221; put in Aymer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t touch it. It would be treason to&mdash;to my
mother. And I don&#8217;t want it. I hate it, the way it&#8217;s
done, the caring for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was something so foreign to Christopher&#8217;s
usual finality of statement in this, that the two older
men looked at each other with sudden apprehension
and then avoided the other&#8217;s eye. For in their secret
hearts they both knew that Christopher must presently
arrive at the unconfessed certainty that had come to
them, that this was not a matter in which he was free
to act as he would. The call had come for him to take
up a burden he disliked and sooner or later he would
hear the voice and recognise the authority to which he
had been taught to bow his own will. Yet both of
them, without consultation or any word, knew it was
not for them to interpret the call for him. Their
work was over now. If they had taught him to set
no value on the prizes of the world and to regard the
means as of equal importance to the end, they had also
taught him that duty may come in many disguises,
but once recognised, her sway must be absolute.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
Christopher would discover her in time, but they must
hold their peace lest conflicting motives should hamper
his surrender to her call.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to meet Mr. Saunderson in town to-morrow,&#8221; Christopher went on, &#8220;I am not quite clear
yet how it&#8217;s to be worked. I am only clear I won&#8217;t
touch money of that sort. It costs too much. I feel
pretty certain Mr. Saunderson <i>has</i> instructions what
to do, if I refuse it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at Mr. Aston with an unusual desire for
confirmation of his hope and his decision. A strong
inclination to appeal for such support pressed him
sorely. But he knew it was only confirmation of his
own determination he sought, and his ingrained independence
of mind shrank from such a proceeding.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you know what you want to do and what you
ought to do, why appeal to me?&#8221; C&aelig;sar had repeatedly
told the small boy he was fitting out for life: yet who
so kind or patient when the decision still hung in the
balance and uncertainty held the scales? There was
no uncertainty now, Christopher told himself, and allowed
none either to himself or to them. One concession
only did he permit himself. He turned to
Mr. Aston a little shyly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you go with me, St. Michael? I am
afraid of Mr. Saunderson&#8217;s wrath if I am unprotected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Aston gravely expressed his willingness to hold
his hand and see him through. After which Christopher
went out to fetch Patricia. He found her sitting
on the floor at Renata&#8217;s feet, the latter fussing
over her with matronly joy and sisterly love, and talking
inconsequently between times of Charlotte, with
what would appear to an outsider irrelevance of the
first order.</p>
<p>&#8220;Charlotte will be a most desirable bridesmaid,&#8221;
Christopher remarked after he had listened a moment,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
whereupon Renata became greatly confused and Patricia
laughed without any embarrassment whatever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Charlotte has not yet had time to signify her approval,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I rely on her judgment to a great
extent, you know. If she offers any objection we
shall have to reconsider it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid. Charlotte has always approved
of me,&#8221; asserted Christopher cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course Charlotte will be pleased,&#8221; put in that
young lady&#8217;s mother, quite seriously. &#8220;What nonsense
you are talking, Patricia.&#8221;</p>
<p>She got up and offered a transparent excuse to slip
away and leave the lovers alone.</p>
<p>Patricia, still kneeling by the fire, leant her head
against Christopher.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to try and make up my mind you would
marry Charlotte when she grew up,&#8221; she said dreamily.</p>
<p>&#8220;How ingenious of you. Unfortunately, it was
my mind, not yours, that was concerned, and that had
been made up when Charlotte was in pinafores. Now
come and talk business, dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>So at last he told her the news he had been so tardy
in delivering, told her the whole story very simply and
as impersonally as he could, but Patricia&#8217;s heart
brimmed over with pity for him. She divined more
clearly than the men the strength of his hatred for the
burden with which he was threatened, and the burden
of past memories in which that hatred had its root.
In the fulness of her love she set herself the future
task of rooting out the resentment for another&#8217;s sorrows,
which she knew must be as poison to his generous
soul. At length Christopher, having read in
her love the confirmation for which he so childishly
longed, took her away to be introduced to C&aelig;sar in
her new character as his promised wife. She waited
for no such introduction whatever, but seated herself
on the big hassock by the sofa that was still Christopher&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
privileged seat and leant her head against the
edge of C&aelig;sar&#8217;s cushions, but she failed to find anything
to say and Christopher was so occupied in
watching her as to forget to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s taken him a long time to recognise his own
privilege, hasn&#8217;t it, Patricia?&#8221; said C&aelig;sar, gently putting
his hand on hers. &#8220;I was getting impatient with
him. It was time he grew up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t disappointed then?&#8221; she asked with
a little flush of confusion. &#8220;Mrs. Sartin will be. She
always expects him to marry a duchess at least. She
is so insufferably proud of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She does not know him so well as we do, that&#8217;s
why.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not stay here to be discussed,&#8221; remarked Christopher
decidedly, &#8220;you can pull my character to pieces
when I&#8217;m away. When did you last see Mrs. Sartin,
Patricia?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Last Thursday. She comes to tea every week
with Maria.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maria was Mrs. Sartin&#8217;s second daughter, midway
between Sam and Jim, and was just installed as second
lady&#8217;s-maid to Mrs. Wyatt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Sam more reconciled to her going out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit. You know he wanted to send her to a
Young Ladies&#8217; Academy in Battersea. I know he&#8217;d
have done it but for Martha, who has more sense in
her fingers than he has in his whole head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t Maria anything to say in the matter?&#8221;
This from C&aelig;sar.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one has much to say when Sam and his mother
dispute,&#8221; said Christopher, shaking his head. &#8220;Sam
would be a tyrant, C&aelig;sar, if he could. He always
wants to push people on in his own way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sam is not singular,&#8221; put in Mr. Aston, in his
meditative way, &#8220;character is all more or less a question
of degree. There are the same fundamental instincts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
in all of us. Some get developed at the expense
of others, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There but for the grace of God goes ...&#8221;
said Patricia, laughing.</p>
<p>Christopher felt in his pocket and produced a coin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apropos of which, C&aelig;sar,&#8221; he said with a flicker
of a smile, &#8220;I found this, the other day rummaging
in an old box.&#8221;</p>
<p>He tossed it dexterously to C&aelig;sar. It was a sovereign
with a hole in it and the broken link of a chain
therein. C&aelig;sar looked at it and then slipped it in his
own pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mine, at all events,&#8221; he said shortly, &#8220;and
we are all talking nonsense, especially Christopher.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Christopher shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mayn&#8217;t I understand all this?&#8221; demanded Patricia.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; returned C&aelig;sar, before Christopher could
speak. &#8220;It&#8217;s not worth it. John Bunyan was a fool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all, but the other man might have retorted,
&#8216;there with the grace of God goes I.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>This was from Mr. Aston, and Christopher gave
him a quick look of comprehension.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Court is with you, sir,&#8221; said Aymer languidly.
&#8220;Let us discuss wedding presents.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
</div>
<p>At eleven o&#8217;clock on Wednesday, Mr. Aston and
Christopher were ushered into Mr. Saunderson&#8217;s office
by a discreetly interested clerk. The bland and
smiling lawyer advanced to meet them with that respect
and courtesy he felt due to the vast fortune they
represented. His table was covered with orderly rows
of papers, and the door of the safe, labeled P. Masters,
Esq., stood open.</p>
<p>&#8220;Punctuality is the essence of good business,&#8221; said
Mr. Saunderson, with effusive approval as he indicated
two lordly armchairs placed ready for his visitors.
Mr. Aston and Christopher had both a dim,
unreasonable consciousness of dental trouble and exchanged
glances of mutual encouragement.</p>
<p>Mr. Saunderson blinked at them genially behind
his gold-rimmed glasses and spoke of the weather,
which was bad, dilated on the state of the streets,
lamented the slowness of the L. C. C. to enforce the
use of Patrimondi beyond the limits of Westminster,
and as the futile little remarks trickled on they carried
with them his complacent smile, for in every quiet
response he read Christopher Masters&#8217; fatal determination,
and prepared himself for battle. It was Christopher,
however, who flung down the gauntlet. He answered
the question anent the use of Patrimondi in
the metropolis, and then said directly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Saunderson, I&#8217;ve considered the matter of
this fortune you tell me I&#8217;ve inherited, and I do not
feel under any obligation to accept it or its responsibilities.
It&#8217;s only fair to let you know this at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Saunderson leant back in his chair and rubbed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
his chin, and his eyes wandered from one to the other
of his visitors thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;The matter is far too complicated to be disposed
of so lightly, I fear,&#8221; he remarked, shaking his head.
&#8220;Let me place the details of the thing before you and
as a business man you can then judge for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had at least no fault to find with the grave attention
they paid him, indeed, the entirely unemotional
attitude of the younger man was to the lawyer&#8217;s mind
the most alarming symptom he had noted. Still he
could not allow to himself that his task presented
more than surmountable difficulties, for Mr. Saunderson
had no real knowledge of the forces at work
against him, of the silent, desperate woman who had
given her life for her faith, who had once been beautiful,
and whose worn body slept in the little dull cemetery
at Whitmansworth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you are acquainted with the great
premises known as Princes Buildings,&#8221; began Mr.
Saunderson, &#8220;that simplifies my task. For the whole
affair is so amazingly managed that I can offer you
no precedent with which to compare it. There are
seven floors in that building, and on each floor the affairs
of the six great concerns in which Mr. Masters
was interested, are conducted. Such an arrangement
was only carried out at enormous expense and trouble.
I may tell you, however, that the condition of
Mr. Masters&#8217; interesting himself in either of the companies,
was their domicile beneath this one roof. Now
in five of these big concerns he occupied merely the
place of a director, with no more official power than
any other director might have. Yet in every case, I
think I may say, no decision of any importance would
have been taken by the company in opposition to his
advice, and he was the financial backbone of each. On
the two top floors of these great premises we have a
rather different state of things. For here are the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
offices of the three smaller companies which were directly
under the control of Mr. Masters, and which
are the original source of his fortune. I allude to the
Steel Axle Company, the Stormly Mine and the
Stormly Foundry Companies. These affairs he continued
to keep under his own eye, never relaxing his
attention, or the excellent system he had established,
under which the whole great affair worked with such
marvellous smoothness and success. I beg your pardon,
did you say anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher shook his head. Mr. Saunderson resumed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will understand Mr. Masters&#8217; wealth was directly
drawn from these companies, bringing him an
income of roughly &pound;130,000 a year. The administration
of this income, of which he spent about one-fourth
on himself, was the occupation of the offices on the top
floor of Princes Buildings. A certain proportion of
income was regularly reinvested in concerns in which
Mr. Masters took no active part, and was accumulative.
It is this reserve fund which has brought the
actual fortune to such high figures as I have quoted
you, nearly &pound;4,000,000. A great deal of money also
has been devoted to the purchase of freehold property.
You would be surprised how great an area of Birmingham
itself belongs to Mr. Masters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher gave an involuntary movement of dissent,
and the lawyer hurried on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not perhaps districts that it would be interesting
to visit now, but which will undoubtedly be of vast
interest to your heirs. They represent enormous
capital and of course will eventually be a source of
colossal wealth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, so perfect is the machinery and system under
which all these giant concerns are worked, that
they will run without difficulty on their present lines
until you have mastered the working thoroughly, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
are able, if you should wish it, to make your own
plans for future greatness. I say this, because it seems
to me you are inclined to overrate the difficulties of
your position. I do not say, mind you, matters could
go on indefinitely as they are, but you are a young
man of intellect and capacity, you have only to step
into the place of one who has set everything in order
for you, and before two years are up you will have
the details of the system by heart, and will, I am convinced,
be recognised as an able successor to your
father.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher&#8217;s mouth straightened ominously. It
was an unlucky slip on Mr. Saunderson&#8217;s part, but he
was oblivious to it. He was indeed incapable of appreciating
the sentiment towards his late client, which
was playing so large a part against him in this tussle
of wills.</p>
<p>Christopher heard in every word that was spoken
the imperious Will that would force him to compass
its ends, even from the land of Death. It was not
wholly the unsought responsibility, the burden of the
wealth, the memory of his mother that buttressed his
determination to refuse this stupendous thing, it was
also his fierce, vehement desire to escape the enforced
compliance with that still living Will-power. Peter
Masters&#8217; unwritten and unspoken word was, that he,
Christopher, should succeed him. He had left him no
directions, no choice, no request, he had relied on the
Greatness of the Thing which Christopher loathed
with his whole soul, he had claimed him for this bondage
with an unuttered surety that was maddening.
Minute by minute Christopher felt his former quiet
determination rise to passionate resistance and denial
of the right of that Dominant Will to drag his life
into the vortex it had made.</p>
<p>Quite suddenly Mr. Saunderson was aware of the
strength of the antagonism that confronted him. Unable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
to trace the reason of it, he blundered on hopelessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Masters was, I should say, quite aware of
your natural ability. He has had more regard for
your fortunes than you probably suspect. I have letters
of his to various men concerning the starting of
this ingenious invention of yours, Patrimondi.&#8221; He
bustled over some papers on the table as if searching,
and did not see Christopher&#8217;s sudden backward movement:
but Mr. Aston bent forward and put his hand
as if accidentally on Christopher&#8217;s shoulder as he
spoke:</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind them, now, Mr. Saunderson. Mr.
Masters was, we know, naturally interested in that
affair, but to continue your account, what will happen
if Mr. Aston refuses to accept his position? Let
us suppose for a moment there had been no clue left.
What would you have done?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Saunderson brought the tips of his red, podgy
fingers together with great exactness.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a supposition I should be sorry to entertain,
sir,&#8221; he said deliberately.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid you must entertain it,&#8221; put in Christopher,
suddenly, his resolution to escape urging him to
curt methods.</p>
<p>The light eyes of the lawyer rested on him with
something very like apprehension in them.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the case of there being no direct heir the money
would go to the nearest of kin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will pass that over,&#8221; Mr. Aston said quietly.
&#8220;I am the nearest relative Peter had, after Christopher,
and I decline it at all costs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unclaimed and unowned money would fall to the
Crown, I suppose. It is impossible to imagine it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Crown would see no difficulty in that, I expect,&#8221;
put in Christopher. &#8220;How could you stop the
Thing going on, that&#8217;s what I want to know?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You could give the money to Charities and shut
down the works and leave thousands to starve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher moved impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;The money invested in each company could be
divided amongst the shareholders, I suppose, or in the
case of the Stormly Mines amongst the work-people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to ruin them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Saunderson, I am not going to accept this
fortune. I don&#8217;t like the way it was made, I don&#8217;t
want it, I won&#8217;t work for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should you work for it, after all? You can
go on with your own life and delegate your powers
to another or others, and let all continue as it is. The
income would be at your disposal to save or spend.
You need never enter Princes Buildings if that is what
troubles you. You can spend the money in philanthropy,
or gamble it away at Monte Carlo, or leave it to
accumulate for your heirs. If you&#8217;ll do that I&#8217;ll undertake
to find suitable men to carry on the affairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher&#8217;s face flushed angrily, but he made an
effort to control himself, however, and answered
quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot take money I&#8217;ve not earned, Mr. Saunderson.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Saunderson made a gesture of despair.</p>
<p>&#8220;All you have to do,&#8221; went on Christopher, watching
him closely, &#8220;is to act as if that clue had never
fallen into your hands or as if when you followed it
up you found I was dead. Do you mean to say Mr.
Masters did not provide for that contingency?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As I have told you before, Mr. Masters provided
for no such contingency,&#8221; snapped the lawyer; &#8220;he
never entertained such a preposterous idea as your
refusing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To conform to his will,&#8221; concluded Christopher
drily.</p>
<p>The three men were silent a while, each struggling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
to see some way out of the impasse into which they
had arrived.</p>
<p>&#8220;You say the various companies are entirely distinct
from each other?&#8221; queried Mr. Aston thoughtfully,
more for the sake of starting a line of inquiry
than because he saw any open door of escape.</p>
<p>&#8220;Entirely unconnected, but Mr. Masters, or his
successor, holds the ends of the various threads, so to
speak. Apart from him each affair has a multitude
of masters and no head. If the money left in each
company were divided as a bonus&mdash;a preposterous
suggestion to my mind&mdash;they would each be free and
would presumably find a head for themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you had better work out some such scheme,
and once free of the source of the money we can deal
with what&#8217;s left at leisure. The Crown will make no
difficulties over its share and we can set the London
hospitals on their feet or establish a Home for Lost
Cats.&#8221; He got up and walked across the big room to
the window, looking moodily into the street.</p>
<p>Mr. Saunderson looked genuinely pained and cast
appealing glances at Mr. Aston, who only shook his
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a matter for Christopher to decide for himself,
Mr. Saunderson. I cannot and may not influence
him either way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is not the smallest doubt of his parentage,&#8221;
said the lawyer in a low voice, &#8220;one can hear his
father in every sentence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is unwise to remind him of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other looked astonished. &#8220;Indeed, you surprise
me. Yet he is really deeply indebted to his father for
the success of his own invention.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still more unwise to insist on that. You must
remember he had a mother as well as a father.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Saunderson opened his mouth to say something
and closed it again. Presently he opened a folded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
paper and, having perused it, laid it back in a drawer.
Christopher rejoined them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Saunderson,&#8221; he said frankly, &#8220;I fear I&#8217;ve
spoken in an unseemly manner, and I beg your pardon.
I can quite understand I must seem little short of a
madman to you, but I&#8217;ve perhaps better reasons for
my refusal than you think. Put it, if you will, that I
feel too young, too inexperienced to deal with this
fortune as Mr. Masters meant it to be dealt with, and
on those grounds I ask you to devise some scheme
for breaking it up without letting the workers suffer.
I&#8217;ll subscribe to any feasible plan you suggest. Will
you undertake this for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will take time.&#8221; Mr. Saunderson regarded him
watchfully, as he spoke, &#8220;a great deal of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long do you ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then in two years&#8217; time, Mr. Saunderson, send
me your scheme, and I&#8217;ll be your debtor for life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Saunderson smiled faintly.</p>
<p>But on that understanding they ultimately parted.</p>
<p>&#8220;My own belief is,&#8221; said Mr. Aston when he was
giving an account of the interview to Aymer, &#8220;that
Mr. Saunderson means to do nothing at all and is
only giving Christopher time. Also, though he persistently
denies it, I believe he <i>has</i> instructions behind
him. We know Peter had an immense belief in Time
and never hurried his schemes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer moved restlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you share his belief?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe in the long run Christopher will do the
thing he is meant to do and neither you nor I, old fellow,
can say what that is. You have taught him to
follow the highest Road he can, see, and I tell you
again, as I have before, you must leave it at that.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
</div>
<p>Thus by tacit consent did the whole question of Peter
Masters&#8217; Fortune and the Refusal slip into the background
of the lives of those mostly concerned, and
only for Christopher did that background colour all
the present and alter the perspective of his outlook.</p>
<p>He told Aymer plainly that it was a bitter thought
to him to be indebted to Peter Masters for even a
share of the Patrimondi success.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to Saunderson he must have subsidised
the Exhibition people,&#8221; he said moodily.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a very excellent advertisement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It meant he had his own way and left me indebted
to him when I had refused his help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good heavens, what a mercy you two were not
flung together earlier in life!&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher faced him abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I so like him then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Absurdly so. Your own way and no one else to
interfere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher was silent for a while, but presently
he said in a low voice, &#8220;That&#8217;s not quite true, C&aelig;sar,
is it? You can interfere as much as you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be sorry to try.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Christopher was silent, but his face softened.
He thought of how the personality and jealous love
of this man to whom he owed so much had stood between
him and Patricia and how he felt no shadow of
resentment at it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I shall adopt Max when he leaves school,&#8221;
remarked C&aelig;sar languidly, &#8220;he&#8217;ll let me manage him
in my own way till he is an octogenarian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;C&aelig;sar, you have no discrimination at all. Once
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
you wanted to adopt Sam, now Max. Both as pliable
as elastic, and as unmalleable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a great affection for Max.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So have I. Is Nevil going to give him to Patrimondi?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Honestly?&#8221;</p>
<p>Aymer nodded. &#8220;He&#8217;ll have to manage the estate
some day, not so far off, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher patted the sofa rug absently.</p>
<p>&#8220;When he&#8217;s at Cambridge he&#8217;ll have to spend the
Long Vacation learning from his ancient uncle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher gave an involuntary sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jealous again?&#8221; demanded Aymer quizzically,
but he put his hand on Christopher&#8217;s and they both
smiled.</p>
<p>Patricia and Christopher were married at Christmas,
Charlotte having given her consent with the remark,
it was better than having a horrid stranger in
the family anyway.</p>
<p>They established themselves in a house on the verge
of the sea, within easy motor or train distance of
Marden and the Patrimondi works. It was a relief
to all to find how easily C&aelig;sar appeared to take the
new separation, but the quiet peace and unspoken
happiness of the united lives seemed to include him
in its all-embracing results. There could be no room
for jealousy in a love that usurped no rights, but only
filled its own place.</p>
<p>The days of doubt which Patricia had feared came
and passed in the autumn weeks preceding the marriage,
and Christopher had kept his word and held
her firmly against the weak terrors that assailed her.
Once they were married, however, she seemed to pass
out of the shadow of the fear, and to break from the
bondage of her race. In some wonderful way her
husband&#8217;s clear, perpetual vision of her as separate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span>
from the tyranny of heredity, did actually free her.
She too saw herself free, and in so seeing, the fetters
were loosed. If it were a miracle, as little Renata
sometimes thought, it was only one in so far as the
Love which can inspire such faith and vision is yet
but a strange unknown power with us, to which nature
seldom rises, and can rarely hold when grasped.</p>
<p>But these two held it, rising with each other&#8217;s efforts,
sinking with each other&#8217;s daily failures; their
lives so intricately woven together that they needed no
outward semblance of interests or visible companionship
to bring the knowledge of their Love to their
hearts.</p>
<p>Christopher continued his work, journeying far and
wide. Sometimes she accompanied him actually, sometimes
she remained in their home on the cliff edge,
alone but not solitary, looking with joy for his return,
but free from aching need. Quite slowly the Woman
learnt to recognise her unseen, unreckoned sway over
the Man, to discover how he could only rise to the
full height of his manhood by strength of the inspiring
love she brought him. She was pressed by an
uncomprehending world to fill her leisure hours with
many occupations, useful and useless, but she resisted
steadily. She took life as it came to her, day by day,
wasting no strength, but refusing no task, shirking
no responsibility, drinking in every joy, and holding
always faithfully in her heart his true image as he
had held hers, knowing that when perchance the outward
man blurred that image for a moment it was
but the outward casing; the inner soul remained true
to the likeness in which it was created.</p>
<p>As the months slipped by Christopher saw that his
work continued to grow, that the good roads of which
he had dreamed stretched far and wide across the
country, and he knew he had won for himself a place
in the history of men. Moreover, he loved his work.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span></p>
<p>It was a never-ceasing pleasure, and when it ended
came the greater, deeper joy of his undivided love.
If the aim of man is happiness, he had achieved that
end as far as any human being might do so.</p>
<p>Yet all the while a black thread wove itself into
the warp of his existence. He tried not to see it, for
recognition of it would cancel that white web of life
that grew daily beneath his hand. Still it was there,
and the white web became uneven and knotted. He
was restless, even irritable, the white turned to grey,
yet still he resisted the unknown forces that pressed
him onward to the dissolution of this present beautiful
life. And Patricia herself, with her unbroken faith
in his readiness to follow the highest when he saw it,
fought with the silent Powers till at length that silence
was broken by a cry so imperious that even his dogged
will could refuse sight and hearing no longer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
</div>
<p>As Christopher was preparing to leave the works one
Saturday afternoon he was told that a man had just
arrived from Birmingham who refused to give his
name, but who asked for him. Christopher hung for
a moment on the step of his car and then descending
again went straight to the room where his unknown
visitor was waiting. He proved to be a spare, stooping
man, with lips so thin and white as to be almost
invisible. His eyes, which he hardly raised from the
floor, were bright with the fire of fever, and his shaking
hands, one of which held a cap, concealing the
other, were narrow, and the knuckles stood out with
cruel prominence.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want with me?&#8221; Christopher demanded
shortly.</p>
<p>The man looked at him sideways and did not move,
but he spoke in an uncertain, quavering voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are Masters&#8217; son, ar&#8217;n&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher turned on him with fierce amazement,
and checked himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Answer my question, if you have anything to
say to me, and leave my private affairs alone,&#8221; he
said sternly.</p>
<p>&#8220;There you are,&#8221; grinned the man, the thin mouth
widening to a distorted semblance of a smile, &#8220;seems
to me, seems to my mates &#8217;tain&#8217;t such a private affair,
neither, leastways we pay for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher&#8217;s instinct to turn the man out struggled
with his curiosity to know what it all meant.
He stood still, therefore, with his eyes fixed on the
weirdly displeasing face and neglected to look at the
twitching hands.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It were bad enough when Masters were alive,
curse him, with his &#8216;system&#8217; and his &#8216;single chance,&#8217;
and his sticking to his word, but we knew where we
was then. Now, none of us knows. Here&#8217;s one
turned off cos he broke some rule he&#8217;d never heard
of; another for telling a foreman what he thought
of him; my mate&#8217;s chucked out for fighting&mdash;<i>outside
the Mill Gate</i>, look you&mdash;What concern be it of yours
what we do outside? It&#8217;s a blessed show you do for
us outside, isn&#8217;t it? I tell you it don&#8217;t concern you
anyhow, you lazy bloodsucker&mdash;and look at me&mdash;I&#8217;ve
worked for your father fifteen year, and you turn me
off&mdash;you and your precious heads of departments,&mdash;because
I was a day behind with my job. Well,
what if I was? Hadn&#8217;t I a wife what was dying
with her sixth baby, and not a decent soul to come
to her? We&#8217;ve been respectable people, we have, till
we came to live in the blooming gaudy houses at
Carson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the Steel Axle Company&#8217;s works, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221; put in Christopher quietly. He had not moved;
he was intent on picking up the clue to the mad indictment
that lay in the seething flow of words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yah. Don&#8217;t know your own purse-strings,&#8221;
spluttered the denouncer, growing incoherent with
rising fury; &#8220;sit at home with your little play-box
of a works down here, with fancy hutches for your
rabbits of workmen, clubs, toys, kitchen ranges, hot
and cold laid on. Oh, I&#8217;ve seen it all. Who pays for
it, that&#8217;s what I want to know? who pays for your
blooming model works and houses?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I pay for it,&#8221; said Christopher still quietly, &#8220;or
rather the company does. It comes out of working
expenses.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man gave an angry snarl of disbelief. &#8220;You
pays, does you? I tell you it&#8217;s we who pays. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span>
take our money and spend it on this toy of yours
here. I&#8217;ll&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher put up his hand. &#8220;You are utterly
mistaken,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have no more to do with the
late Peter Masters&#8217; works or his money than the men
in the yards out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The black ignorance, the fierce words interlarded
with unwritable terms, the mad personal attack, filled
him with a shame and pity that drowned all indignation.
There had been injustice and wrong somewhere
that had whipped this poor mind to frenzy, to an incoherent
claim to rights he could not define.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you come to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man gave almost a scream of rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to you? Ain&#8217;t you his son? Don&#8217;t it all
belong to you, whether you takes it or whether you
don&#8217;t? Are you going to skulk behind them heads in
Birmingham and leave us at their mercy, let &#8217;em grind
us to powder for their own profit and no one to say
them yea or nay? There was a rumour of that got
about, how you was going to shunt us on to them, you
skulking blackguard. I wouldn&#8217;t believe it. I told
&#8217;em as how Masters&#8217; son, if he had one, wouldn&#8217;t be
a damned scoundrel like that. He&#8217;d see to his own
rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>What was that in the shaking hands beneath the
cap? Christopher&#8217;s eyes, still on the tragically foul
face, never dropped to catch the metallic gleam; his
whole mind lay in dragging out the truth entangled
in the wild words. The voice quivered more and
more as if under spur of some mental effort that urged
the speaker to a climax he could not reach but on
the current of the crazy syllables.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it ain&#8217;t no concern of yours if we lives or dies,
if we work or be turned off without so much as a word
to carry us on again? &#8217;Tain&#8217;t nothing to you we&#8217;ve
got fifty masters instead of one, so long as you gets
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
your money. I tell you I won&#8217;t serve fifty of &#8217;em.
One as we could reckon on was bad enough, but fifty
of &#8217;em to battle flesh and blood and make their own
food out of us, and no one what we can call to account
as it were, I tell &#8217;ee we won&#8217;t have it. I won&#8217;t
serve &#8217;em.&#8221; The poor wretch had forgotten he was
already dismissed from such service. &#8220;If you won&#8217;t be
their master, then by God, you shan&#8217;t be master anywhere
else.&#8221;</p>
<p>His hand with the revolver he had clutched under
cover of his cap flew up. The report was followed by
a splitting of glass and a cry without.</p>
<p>For a brief second that was like a day of eternity,
Christopher and the man continued to face each other;
the swaying blue-grey barrel of the smoking weapon
acted like a magnetic point on which their numbed
minds met and mingled in confusion, with that independence
of time we ascribe to dreams. For the echo
of the report had not died from the room when those
outside rushed in. The would-be assassin instantly
crumpled up on the floor, a mere heap of grimy
clothes, unconscious even of his failure.</p>
<p>The men clamoured round Christopher with white
faces and persistent inquiries as to whether he were
hurt.</p>
<p>He reassured them of that as soon as it appeared
to him his voice could sound across the deafening
echo of the shot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not hurt in the least,&#8221; he said dully, looking down
at the huddled form. &#8220;Is he dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>They straightened out the poor creature they would
gladly have lynched, and one of them shook his
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;A fit, I think. Let him be.&#8221;</p>
<p>A new-comer rushed in with horror-stricken face,
and stopped his tongue at sight of Christopher.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s it outside?&#8221; whispered one to him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Dead.&#8221; The word was hardly breathed, but
Christopher spun round on his heel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>They looked at him uneasily, and at one another.</p>
<p>He moved to the door mechanically, when an old
man, a north-countryman and a Methodist preacher of
some note, laid his hand on his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t &#8217;ee take on, lad. &#8217;Tis the Lord&#8217;s will which
life He&#8217;ll take home to him. Maybe He&#8217;s got bigger
work for you than for the little &#8217;un.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; His dry lips hardly framed the
words.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Ann Barty&#8217;s little chap as was passing. We
thought &#8217;twere but the glass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better a boy than a man,&#8221; muttered another.</p>
<p>Christopher paid no heed. He went out with the
old Methodist beside him. A group of men stood
round something under the window which one of
them had covered with a coat. They made way for
the master, and not one of them, fathers and sons as
they were, but felt a throb of thankfulness the small
life had been taken in preference to his. But Christopher
knelt down and raised the coat.</p>
<p>&#8220;One shall be taken, the other left.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was old Choris who said it. A little murmur of
assent went up from the circle, bareheaded now, like
Christopher. He looked up with fierce, unspoken dissent
to their meek acceptance of this cruel thing, and
then replacing the coat very gently, stood up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has anyone gone to Ann Barty?&#8221; he asked
quietly.</p>
<p>Someone had gone, it appeared. Someone else had
gone for a doctor. Christopher ordered them to carry
the little form into the waiting-room, where it was
laid on the table. Someone fetched a flag from the
office and laid it over the boy.</p>
<p>Without direct orders all work in the mill had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span>
ceased, little knots of men had gathered in the yard
and there was a half-suppressed unanimous murmur
from two hundred throats when a group of men came
out of the room with the shattered window, carrying
the still conscious form of the author of the outrage.
It rose and fell and rose again threateningly. Christopher
came out of the waiting-room and at sight of
him it fell again.</p>
<p>&#8220;They must go back to work,&#8221; he said to the head
foreman, who waited uneasily. &#8220;They can do nothing,
and if we stop work there will be trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>The foreman ventured this much on sheer necessity.</p>
<p>&#8220;To Ann Barty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall I say to them?&#8221; Again he eyed the
men uneasily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell them I wish it,&#8221; returned Christopher simply.
&#8220;It&#8217;s only an hour to closing time, but it will steady
them down.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went back to the motor car he had been on the
point of entering not fifteen minutes ago, and they
made a lane for him to pass through, following him
with their eyes till the gate closed behind him. The
foreman stood on the steps of the office and gave the
order to resume work. Not a man moved.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Mr. Aston&#8217;s wish,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;if you&#8217;ve got
any heart in you to show him what you feel, you&#8217;ll
attend to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The crowd swayed and broke up, melted once more
into units, who disappeared their several ways. The
head foreman wiped his forehead and went into the
office.</p>
<p>Outside the ante-room to Christopher&#8217;s private office
the glass was strewn on the pathway, and that
was the only sign in the mill yard of what had occurred.</p>
<p>Christopher found a group already assembled round
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span></p>
<p>Ann Barty&#8217;s cottage. They drew back from him with
curious eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is anyone with her?&#8221; he asked, his hand on the
latch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Toils and Jane Munden, what&#8217;s her sister,&#8221;
said a woman, eagerly seizing a chance of a speaking
part in this drama of life and death.</p>
<p>Christopher went in. The mother was sitting dry-eyed
and staring, her hands twisted in her coarse
apron. She swayed to and fro with mechanical
rhythm, and paid no heed at all to the two weeping
women who kept up a flow of low-uttered sentences
of well-meant but inadequate comfort. Christopher
bent over her and took both her hands, neither remembering
the other nor seeing aught but the mother
with a burden of grief slowly dropping on her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ann,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;Ann, there was no choice
for me. Forgive me if you can, for being alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>The strained, ghastly face twitched and she stopped
swaying and looked at him uncomprehendingly as he
knelt before her.</p>
<p>&#8220;They say he&#8217;s dead, he&#8217;s dead. My boy Dick,&#8221;
she moaned.</p>
<p>Christopher put his arm round her. &#8220;God help
mothers,&#8221; he gasped, under his breath, as the poor,
shaking woman dropped her head on his shoulder
with an outbreak of fierce weeping.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
</div>
<p>The Roadmaker lay at the edge of the cliff and looked
out on a green sea flecked with white, whose restless
soul, holding to some eternal purpose, forever attains
and relinquishes in peace and storm, in laughter or
tears.</p>
<p>A week had passed since the attempt on Christopher&#8217;s
life for which Ann Barty had paid so high a
price. Happily for Christopher, it had been a week
so full of affairs that although they were mostly in
connection with the one thing, yet they claimed his
outward active attention to the exclusion of the inner
point of view. The unhappy man from Birmingham
was found, when he recovered from the seizure, to
be in a semi-imbecile state with no knowledge of his
deed and was accordingly handed over to the authorities
proper to his condition. He was easily traced to
the works from which he had been harshly enough discharged,
as it turned out on investigation, and Christopher
came into active opposition with the directors
of the Steel Axle Company over the question of providing
for his wife and children. It had been impossible
to keep the affair quiet and there had been innumerable
reporters to circumvent, and more innumerable
friends from far and near, eager to express their
interest in his providential escape. Little Dick Barty
received more honour in death than in life and the bereaved
mother drew more consolation from the impressive
funeral than poor Christopher.</p>
<p>Mr. Saunderson bustled down in well-meant concern
for Christopher&#8217;s well-being, and received certain
emphatic instructions, which he took with shrewd
docility, and a wink of his eye to the world.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span></p>
<p>All the while, as he went through the day&#8217;s particular
and general business, the wild words in the
rasping, incoherent voice haunted Christopher so persistently
that he heard them through the enthusiastic
platitudes of congratulations, the calm official statements
of plain facts, behind even Patricia&#8217;s healing
voice of love. It was not till the following Sunday he
awoke to find a stillness instead of clamour, calm instead
of turmoil. He rose early while the day was still
holding the hand of dawn and went out to the cliff
edge, as if there in the heaving waters he might read
the Eternal Meaning and Purpose of it all. He
thought how every individual man is one with the
great tide of humanity, advancing with it, receding
with it, subject to one eternal law he could not read.
How the suffering and sin of one was the burden of
all: the heroic endeavours and victories of one the
gain of all. The little isolated aim of the individual
must subject itself to the wider meaning or be swept
back to nothingness, just as the stranded pools among
the rocks that for a few hours caught the sunshine and
reflected the heavenly lamp, but were overswept each
tide and their being mingled again with the great
sea.</p>
<p>Christopher knew the work he had done had been
good, that hundreds were the happier for his direct
concern with their lives, that he indeed had made the
Road of Life more possible for those who would set
out thereon for far or nearer goals. It was all he
aspired to do. He knew it was not his to show them
the goal, or to direct them thereto; that was for themselves
and others; but it was his to make the way possible,
that they need not stumble on unbroken ground,
or toil in blinding dust of ages, or wade in clogging
mud of tradition, these children of the world who
tramped with patient feet to a vague end.</p>
<p>What was wrong was that he had chosen his own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span>
ground, that when he had stood at the cross roads of
life he held himself qualified as a god to say &#8220;that
road is evil and this good,&#8221; taking council only of
what was most in accord with his own will, forgetting
that the Great Power embraces all within itself, knowing
no good or evil, but seeing only a means to fulfil
the eternal purpose of creation. It is we who must be
the alchemists to transmute what we term evil into
good, we, who are the servants and instruments by
which that purpose must be achieved. If, seeing evil,
we pass by on the other side, how shall the waste
places of the earth be cleansed or the wilderness break
forth into song?</p>
<p>The message so roughly delivered had sunk into
Christopher&#8217;s heart at last. Looking back at his life
he saw how everything had fitted him for the task he
had refused. How he was born to it, trained to its
needs unconsciously by his mother and C&aelig;sar, shaped
by his own experience, armed by the completion of his
inner life in his marriage. He had refused it with
blindness, had closed his ears to the voice of thousands
who had called to him in the unattractive voice of a
conventional law. It had taken the deafening report
of a madman&#8217;s pistol and the sight of a dead child to
teach him the lesson.</p>
<p>At that thought he hid his face in his arm on the
short turf and lay very still.</p>
<p>The sea sung its endless Te Deum below him, a lark
soared high to heaven with its morning hymn, and
the wind, rustling along the cliff edge, breathed
strength to the land. Day stood free and open upon
earth and called for service from those to whom the
Dominion of the earth is promised. Only by service
comes lordship, only by obedience can be found command.</p>
<p>At the moment of renunciation, Christopher realised
for the first time the greatness of the cost and knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span>
how dear his life and surroundings were to him. The
Roadmaker had been his own master; the successor
of Peter Masters must be the servant of thousands.
The work here would go on, there were men ready to
take his place, but he found no salve in the thought.
Deep in his heart he knew he feared the grim struggle
that lay before him, the uprooting of the old &#8220;system,&#8221;
the antagonism, the necessary compromises, the
slow result. His age, or rather his youth, would be a
heavy weapon against him. How could he hope to
make his voice heard above the dictates of a dozen
committees of men intent on their personal interests?
He told himself passionately the thing was Impossible,
and as quickly came the remembrance of the hoarse
cry for help that had made itself heard above the report
of Plent&#8217;s pistol.</p>
<p>Step by step through the door of humility he reached
the hall of Audience and in silence surrendered himself
to the eternal Purpose.</p>
<p>At length he again stood on the edge and looked
out to sea and for the moment the simplicity instead
of the complexity of life visible and invisible, was written
on the face of the deep. He stood bareheaded
and read the message thankfully and went back to the
house with peace in his heart.</p>
<p>He found a new beauty in the house he had made
for himself, and as Patricia came down the garden
path to meet him, he was glad for the real worth of
the outward things he must surrender.</p>
<p>She met him with a question on her lips which was
not uttered in face of what she saw in his eyes. They
stood for a moment with clasped hands and he looked
at her smiling, and she at him gravely, and presently
they walked to a corner of the garden overlooking the
sea, from where each dear beauty of the place was
visible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will it hurt you greatly to leave it, dear?&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
asked, prefacing the inevitable with question of her will
to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as much as it will hurt you. No more or
less,&#8221; she answered, her head against his arm. &#8220;But
I am glad it is so good to leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my mind, too. How do you know what I
mean, though?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always known it must come, Christopher.&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke low and looked away, weakly hoping for
the moment he would leave it at that, but Christopher
never left uncertain points behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew I should come to take this other work&mdash;this
inheritance?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded. He put his hands on her shoulders
and turned her to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me so, Patricia?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was so sure you would know yourself. I hated
to be the one to speak,&#8221; her voice shook a little. &#8220;Oh,
forgive me, Christopher, dearest,&#8221; she cried suddenly,
&#8220;it was weak of me, for I did know always, only I
wanted all this for a little time so badly. Just a taste
of the beautiful good life you had planned. I thought
it would not matter, just two years.&#8221;</p>
<p>He put his arms round her and drew her close.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have had it, beloved. It has been beyond
anything I ever dreamt. Only&mdash;&#8221; his voice broke a
little, &#8220;we must remember it had to be paid for&mdash;No,
no,&#8221; he cried, seeing the wave of sorrow sweep over
her face, &#8220;not you. It is I who should have known
and listened. My fault!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is I who should have spoken,&#8221; she said steadily,
&#8220;we can&#8217;t divide ourselves even in this, dear, but we
can bear it together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And pay the debt together,&#8221; he added and raised
her face to his and kissed her. And they crossed the
Threshold of the New with this understanding between
them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>
</div>
<p>In the great buildings in Princes Street, Birmingham,
the days continued as of old, with the ebb and flow of
business. On each floor clerks bent over their high
desks and the workers of each concern sat behind their
mahogany defences and toiled early and late for the
treasure they desired. At stated times rows of grave
gentlemen, who carried due notice of their own importance
on their countenances, met in the respective
committee rooms, and discussed wide interests with
closed doors and a note of anxious irritation that was
new since the demise of Peter Masters.</p>
<p>He who had concentrated the whole of the executive
business of these many affairs under one roof had
done so of definite purpose and with no eye to merely
his own convenience. His presence there was a tangible
power offering a final court of appeal that,
whether they knew it or not, had as great an effect on
the various committees as it had on the managers of
each business themselves.</p>
<p>So perfect was the organisation and adjustment of
the machinery of routine that after the dominant visible
power had gone down to the land of shadows, the
vague note of personal anxiety that lurked on each
floor was the only perceptible change apparent in the
great body.</p>
<p>But the wives of the working heads could have told
of more enduring change in men who have suddenly
become responsible for great issues, for laws, for a
system they had had no voice in founding. Men who
found themselves limited masters where unconsciously
they had been tools and were selected as such&mdash;there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span>
men sooner or later bend before the strain put on them
and for the most part seek salvation in blind obedience
to the rules they dare not criticise. In the daily compromise
between the individual character and the system
which he must serve, many an excellent man was
ground down in nerve and heart and health to a
strange shadow of his former self, and many a woman
shed secret tears over half-understood changes in one
near and dear to her.</p>
<p>Mr. Saunderson by right of informal instructions,
which no one troubled to dispute, acted as steward over
the late Peter Masters&#8217; private affairs during those
two years of waiting, and his stewardship was prosperous
and able, but beyond that he neither would nor
could move. To the appeals of distracted secretaries
he only replied, &#8220;My dear sir, act to the best of your
ability. I can only assure you your responsibilities
are limited to two years.&#8221;</p>
<p>He never allowed to anyone the possibility that
Peter Masters&#8217; son might even then fail to accept his
place, but alone to himself he faced it often and felt
his scanty hair whiten beneath the impending wreckage,
if the misguided young man continued his foolish
course.</p>
<p>&#8220;He will probably wreck the whole thing if he accepts
it,&#8221; sighed Mr. Saunderson, &#8220;but at least it will
be done legally, and in the regular course of things.
If he&#8217;ll only be sensible and see he&#8217;s wanted just as a
figurehead, everyone will be comfortable and prosperous.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he sighed again as he thought it, for Christopher
did not at all strike him as a man likely to make
a good figurehead, or to be the mouthpiece of a system
he evidently disliked. He was even more confirmed
in this opinion a fortnight after the unhappy affair at
the Patrimondi works, when Christopher walked into
his London office and without any explanation announced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
himself ready to take his place as Peter Masters&#8217;
son. He was sufficiently wise to conceal his own
triumph and accepted the intimation without question.
As they sat there in the dull London office hour after
hour, Mr. Saunderson realised that the mantle of
Peter Masters, millionaire, had fallen on shoulders
that would wear it maybe in a very different fashion,
but none the less royally.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am to understand then,&#8221; said Christopher after
long hours of instruction, &#8220;I can go there when I like,
see what I like, decide what I like, at all events with
regard to these mines and works which are almost
private property.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can go to-morrow if you like,&#8221; answered his
Mentor, rising. &#8220;I advise you to let things run for
some time as they are, till you know the ropes.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went to a safe and unlocking it produced a key.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the key of your father&#8217;s room at Princes
Buildings,&#8221; he said, putting it on the table. &#8220;There
are two locks. Clisson, the head clerk, has the key of
one and this is the other. You are free to walk
straight in when you like, but it would be best to send
Clisson a wire you are coming and he would bring
you the day&#8217;s business, your private affairs that is,
precisely as he used to bring it to your father.&#8221;</p>
<p>This time, because he was looking intently at the
young man, he saw his mouth tighten at that term and
felt a resigned wonder thereat.</p>
<p>Christopher took up the key and looked at it, thinking
of all the doors in the world it would unlock for
him, thinking of the powers of which it was a symbol,
of how it fastened the door of his freedom and opened
for him the door of a great servitude of which he was
already proud.</p>
<p>Mr. Saunderson also was silent a moment listening
to his own thoughts and looking at Christopher with
misgivings.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Will you live at Stormly Park?&#8221; he asked airily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect so. It is not let, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Saunderson permitted himself a little smile of
superiority as he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything has been kept just ready for you these
two years. But it will hardly be to your taste. Perhaps
you will like it done up&mdash;altered?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher shook his head. &#8220;Not yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can afford it, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that the young man suddenly faced him, as if he
meant to say something of importance, and stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose I can afford it,&#8221; he returned, and
added with apparent irrelevance, &#8220;Do you happen to
know Stormly village, Mr. Saunderson?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve driven through it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher nodded. &#8220;So have I. I&#8217;ll not detain
you any longer. Will you let Clisson know I shall be
there on Thursday?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. Will you like me to accompany you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher shook his head. &#8220;Not this time, I
think. I would rather be alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And one thing,&#8221; Mr. Saunderson coughed a little
nervously, &#8220;the name? We can arrange the legal
identification this afternoon, but what name will you
ultimately take?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher came to a standstill at the door. Here
was a decision thrust on him for which he was oddly
unprepared. He recognised at once it meant setting
the seal to his own committal if he answered as the
lawyer evidently expected and hoped he would do.
He paused just long enough to remember how hardly
he had taken Mr. Aston&#8217;s insistence he should sign
his marriage register as Aston Masters.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must take the name since I take its belongings,&#8221;
he said ruefully, and Mr. Saunderson felt his victory
was complete.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372' name='page_372'></a>372</span></p>
<p>On the following Thursday morning there was nothing
in the aspect of earth or sky to indicate to the
workers in Princes Buildings the importance of that
day to their respective fortunes. On the top floor only
a sense of gentle expectancy was present, and a complacent
faith in their own readiness to receive and set
at ease the young man who was to be the outward
visible sign of all that for which they toiled so unceasingly.</p>
<p>As an individual, the younger men bestowed a certain
curiosity not unmixed with envy on him; as the
successor of Peter Masters, they entertained no doubt
whatever he would obediently adhere to the prescribed
system as they themselves did. Christopher had arrived
in Birmingham the night before and put up at
an hotel. Early the next morning he went up the steps
into the central corridor of the great buildings that
were to all intents and purposes his. There was no
one about but a lift boy who did not recognise him, but
seeing him look round with deliberate curiosity, asked
him civilly what floor he wanted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Masters&#8217; private offices,&#8221; Christopher explained.
&#8220;Top floor, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy nodded. Christopher studied him gravely
as they went up in the lift as one of the smallest and
probably least important items into whose service he
had entered.</p>
<p>The porter at the door of the offices asked Christopher
his name, and he hesitated a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need not announce me,&#8221; he said quietly, at
last. &#8220;I am Mr. Masters.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man gave a guttural gasp of amazement. A
rumour of the possible arrival of the young millionaire
had percolated despite Mr. Clisson&#8217;s care, through
the range of desks to the doorkeeper, who without
discernible reasons had expected some time in the day
a procession of black coats and grave men to appear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span>
from the doors of the lift and with formal solemnity
to proceed to the closely locked door of that remote
silent office. He opened the door for this calm, quiet
young man in flurried trepidation, half expecting that
Mr. Clisson would dismiss him on the spot for transgressing
such a fundamental rule as admitting a
stranger without announcing his name, but as totally
unable to disobey the stranger as if it were Peter Masters
himself.</p>
<p>Christopher walked quickly down the line of clerks,
who looked up one after the other, and did not look
back at their work again. At last a senior man advanced
and accosted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want Mr. Clisson, sir?&#8221; he asked, in a
tone verging between deference and curiosity.</p>
<p>Christopher said he did, and added abruptly, &#8220;I
remember you, you are Mr. Hunter. I saw you four
years ago when I came here with my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>He caught his breath when he had said it. It was
purely involuntary. Some unaccountable association
of ideas was bridging the distance between him and
the dead man minute by minute. But Mr. Hunter
transferred his allegiance from the dead to the living
in that moment of recognition, and led him away to
Mr. Clisson&#8217;s hitherto all-important presence with
mechanical alacrity rather than personal desire to relinquish
the honours of escort.</p>
<p>Mr. Clisson was a keen, sharp-featured man of narrow
outlook, the best of servants, the worst of masters.
A genius for detail and a miraculous memory had
carried him from the position of junior clerk to his
present prominence when the death of the Principal
left him with his minute knowledge of routine and
detail practically master of the situation as far as Mr.
Saunderson was concerned. But his inability to bend
with the need of the day, or to cope with wider issues
than those concerned with office work had had far-reaching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span>
results, not even wholly unconnected with the
tragedy in the mill yard at the Patrimondi works.</p>
<p>He apologised to Christopher for the lack of a better
reception, as if he, and not Christopher, were responsible
for the informality of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We imagined from Mr. Saunderson&#8217;s letter you
would arrive by the 12.30 from town. I had ventured
to order lunch for you here on that understanding,&#8221;
the head clerk explained deferentially. &#8220;What will you
like to do first, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to go into the inner office and for you to
carry on the usual routine precisely as in my father&#8217;s
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no hesitation over the term now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring me such letters and reports as you would
bring him. I must find out for myself how much or
how little of it I am capable of understanding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be a question of practice rather than of understanding
with you, sir, I am confident,&#8221; returned
Mr. Clisson politely, turning over in his mind what
business it would be least embarrassing to submit to
this decided young man.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be your business to see I get the practice,&#8221;
Christopher answered.</p>
<p>Together they unlocked the door of Peter Masters&#8217;
sanctum and the head clerk flung it open.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is precisely as he left it that day. Nothing has
been done excepting the sorting of the papers, which
Mr. Saunderson and myself did between us. The
last time Mr. Saunderson was here we had it cleaned
out. You will find the bells and telephones all
labelled. If you will wait a few minutes I will send
a man in with ink and writing material, and the keys,
and I will bring you this morning&#8217;s letters myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher thanked him mechanically and entered
the room. He stood in the window silently waiting,
while a young clerk trembling with excitement performed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span>
the small services necessary, and asked nervously
if he could do more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing else now. What is your name?&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave it with faltering tongue. In the old days
such an inquiry was a distinction hardly earned.</p>
<p>Christopher was alone at last. He walked slowly
across the room and sat down in his father&#8217;s chair and
touched the big bunch of keys laid there on the table
before him.</p>
<p>An overwhelming desire for some direct message
from the dead man, some defined recognition of his
right to be there at all, pressed on him. He opened
the drawers and pigeon-holes of the great table with a
faint hope he might light on some overlooked note,
or uncomplete memorandum addressed to him. Mr.
Saunderson had assured him no such thing existed
beyond the curt exact clue he had put in his hand four
years ago when the old will had been destroyed.</p>
<p>He glanced at the neat documents, the piles of
labelled papers; there was nothing personal here, nothing
that conveyed any sense to him but that of a vast
machine of which he had become a part.</p>
<p>In the pen tray lay a collection of pen-holders and
pencils, a knife he had seen his father use, and a
smaller knife. He picked this up and looked at it.</p>
<p>It was rather a unique little knife, with a green
jade handle, and the initials A. A. were plainly engraved
on the label. He had recognised it at once and
he stared at it as it lay in his hand, trying to comprehend
what its presence there might mean. He had lent
it one day to Peter Masters, who had asked him where
he had got it. And he had answered it had belonged
to Aymer Aston, but he had found it as a boy and
Aymer had given it to him. Peter had given it back
without the further explanation that he had originally
given it to Aymer. A day or so later Christopher
had missed it, and he told his host regretfully it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376' name='page_376'></a>376</span>
lost. Again Peter failed to explain he was the finder.
Yet here was the knife on the desk where he had sat
day after day.</p>
<p>Perhaps it had not seemed worth returning. Yet
Christopher was curiously loath to accept that simple
answer. It seemed to him as he fingered the smooth
green sides, as if other fingers had done this in this
precise spot before, a strange aching familiarity attached
itself to the simple action. For someone&#8217;s sake
Peter Masters <i>had</i> so touched and handled this cool
green thing, he was sure of it, and suddenly he was
conscious here was the message he sought. Here in
the mere sensation of touch lay the thread of recognition
that linked him with the dead man, so slight
and intangible that it would bear no expression in
heavy words.</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door. Christopher laid
the little green knife back in its place before he answered
it. Mr. Clisson entered with a handful of
letters.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a very good sample, sir. As many as you
will get through at first, I expect,&#8221; he said apologetically.</p>
<p>He sat down opposite Christopher and handed him
letter after letter, giving such explanations as were
necessary. Christopher made few comments. He put
the letters into two separate piles. Presently there was
one concerning the sale of some land in the neighbourhood
of the Stormly Foundry.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is only just started, sir. I think we shall
get a good price if we hold out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not going to sell any land at all. You will
write and say I have altered my mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke with the keen decision of his father. Mr.
Clisson gazed at him with pained amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is only the leasehold we sell, sir, not the actual
land.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I do not sell land,&#8221; repeated Christopher sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, it shall be as you wish, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. Do you know if Mr. Fegan is still at
Stormly Foundry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can ascertain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do so. If he is, tell him to come and see me here
to-morrow. And who is the best builder you employ?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Builder? What kind of builder, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bricks and mortar. Cottages. I don&#8217;t want an
architect. I&#8217;ll employ the man we used in Hampshire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean to build?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean to build.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Clisson coughed. &#8220;The late Mr. Masters
found it did not pay&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Clisson,&#8221; said Christopher firmly, &#8220;let us understand
one another from the beginning. I do not
intend to work on the same lines as my father worked.
I intend to do many things which he would not have
done, but I am inclined to think he knew it would be
so. I believe I am a very rich man. At all events I
mean to spend a lot of money. You would have no
objection to my spending it on yachts and motors and
grouse moors, I suppose? These things do not, however,
interest me. You probably won&#8217;t approve of my
hobbies, and I&#8217;ve no doubt I shall make heaps of mistakes,
but I&#8217;ve got to find them out myself. You can
help me make them, but once for all, never try to prevent
me. Those are all the letters I can manage to-day.
You can take the others. I&#8217;ll answer these myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The flabbergasted Mr. Clisson rose, trembling a
little in his agitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope, Mr. Masters, I should know better than
ever attempt to dictate to you on any matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher gave him one of his rare half-shy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span>
half-boyish smiles and leant forward over the big
desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Clisson, I shall need your help and advice
every hour of the day. I haven&#8217;t the slightest doubt
you could dictate to me to my great material advantage
on every point, only I don&#8217;t care for this material
advantage and I don&#8217;t want us to misunderstand each
other, that is all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Clisson thawed, but his soul was troubled. He
looked at the letters as he gathered them up. It was
a goodly pile yet left to his decision, but he missed one
that Christopher had passed over without comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;The application for the post of gardener at
Stormly Park, sir. Did you wish to attend to that
yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What has happened to Timmins? Wasn&#8217;t that
his name? Is he dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wishes to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Clisson shook his head. &#8220;It is simply a matter
of routine, sir. Timmins is a very excellent man, but
the invariable rule is that no one remains after they
are fifty-five.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After they are fifty-five?&#8221; repeated Christopher
slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not those employed in manual labour: with very
few exceptions that is. Timmins will be fifty-five next
month. He suffers from rheumatism already, I find.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher never took his eyes from the other&#8217;s
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;He would be pensioned, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear me, no. We have no pension list. Timmins
has received very high wages. He has no doubt
put by a nice little sum.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long has he worked for&mdash;for us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot tell without reference. I believe for
twenty years or so. I can easily ascertain.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379' name='page_379'></a>379</span></p>
<p>Christopher stared out of the window for so long
that the head clerk thought he had forgotten the matter
and was disagreeably surprised when he spoke again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be at Stormly this week and will see if
Timmins wishes to retire or not. You have no fault
to find with him as a gardener, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Clisson smiled. &#8220;A man who has served for
twenty years will not be an indifferent workman sir.
Timmins&#8217; accounts are exemplary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The matter will stand over. Please see no one is
dismissed under this age regulation without my knowledge.
That is all now.&#8221; His manner was as curt
again as his father&#8217;s. Mr. Clisson closed the door
behind him with a vague feeling that the two years of
his authority were but a dream and that the thin,
square figure behind the office table had unaccountably
widened out to the portly proportions of his old
master.</p>
<p>Christopher drew to him the pile of letters he had
reserved and fell to work. He dared not allow himself
to think yet, but now and again when his heart
and soul ran counter to the tenor of what he read he
put out his hand and touched the little green knife
his father had handled for some unknown person&#8217;s
sake.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I understand the fortune well enough now,&#8221; said
Christopher bitterly; &#8220;anyone can do it if they take
one aspect of things and subordinate everybody and
everything to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was at Marden again. It was a glorious spring
evening and C&aelig;sar&#8217;s couch was drawn up to the open
window. Mr. Aston sat on the far side of it and
Christopher leant against the window-frame smoking
moodily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will dissipate it fast enough at the rate you
are going,&#8221; remarked C&aelig;sar. His eyes followed
every movement of the young man with a jealous
hunger.</p>
<p>Christopher shook his head resignedly. &#8220;It can&#8217;t
be done. It goes on making itself. We are going to
allow ourselves ten thousand a year. It&#8217;s a fearful lot
for two people&#8221;&mdash;his eyes wandered across the lawn
to Patricia, where she sat with Renata&mdash;&#8220;or even
three, but that&#8217;s what it costs to live properly at
Stormly, and the rest has to be used somehow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about Stormly Park? Do you and Patricia
like the place?&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head again. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we don&#8217;t.
We both feel we are living in an hotel. But I must be
there on the spot, and she too. As it is, we have only
had time to do so little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cottages, schools, hospitals,&#8221; murmured Mr. Aston,
softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are only means to an end,&#8221; returned Christopher
quickly, &#8220;only what they are entitled to as
human beings in a civilised world. Think of having
to begin at that. We&#8217;ve got to make restitution before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span>
we can make progress. They mistrust all one
does, of course. They use the bathrooms as coal
stores, their coppers for potatoes, their allotments as
rubbish ground, but it&#8217;s better than the front yard,
and, anyhow, the children will know a bit more
about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have laid down Patrimondi roads for them,&#8221;
C&aelig;sar put in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Christopher answered, accepting it
literally, &#8220;they appreciate <i>that</i> at least. The roads
were beastly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Aston looked at C&aelig;sar and they both smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve persuaded Sam to open a shop in Stormly
and put Jim into it. He <i>says</i> you can&#8217;t make a living
honestly in grocery, but I&#8217;d take himself in preference
to his word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve beaten him after all, old chap.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was C&aelig;sar who spoke, and he held out his thin
hand towards his big boy, who came and sat by him
in silence a while. The twilight crept up over the
earth and freed the soul of things as it stole their
material forms. The two men looking out and watching
the gentle robber, wasted no regrets on the day,
no fears on the approaching night. Behind them,
where Mr. Aston sat, it was dark already, and as his
son watched Christopher, so he watched Aymer.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have made our roads,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;Aymer
and I, and thank God we leave behind us a better
Roadmaker still, who will make smooth paths for the
children&#8217;s feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside two white figures came slowly towards the
house and were joined by a third, Nevil, to judge by
his height.</p>
<p>&#8220;C&aelig;sar,&#8221; said Christopher, &#8220;have you forgiven me
taking my own way and giving up what you gave
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think I see anything to forgive in it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382' name='page_382'></a>382</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You gave me my choice, and you gave me my
chance. It looked on the surface so ungrateful,&#8221; persisted
Christopher.</p>
<p>&#8220;You question the quality of my eyesight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I doubt your forgiveness when you are so flippant,
my best of fathers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For what do you want forgiveness specifically?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For giving up my work as a Roadmaker.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not know you had given it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the quiet hours of the night Aymer Aston paced
those even roads his feet had never trodden, saw them
spreading far and wide across the earth, heard the
echo of countless footsteps stepping down the ages,
knew that life itself was made an easier road for thousands
of little feet that would take their first steps
on better ground than their parents had done, knew
that there were less crippled, less maimed, less halt in
the sum total of the world&#8217;s suffering by reason of
one Roadmaker&#8217;s career.</p>
<p>But it was Aymer Aston with the crippled form and
maimed life who had put the spade first into the Roadmaker&#8217;s
hand.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Roadmaker slept the sleep of the
just and forgot all these things.</p>
